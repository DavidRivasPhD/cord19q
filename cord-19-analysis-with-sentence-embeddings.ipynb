    "COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) is a free resource of scholarly articles, aggregated by a coalition of leading research groups, about COVID-19 and the coronavirus family of viruses. The dataset can be found on [Semantic Scholar](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research) and there is a research challenge on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge).\n",
    "\n",
    "This project builds an index over the CORD-19 dataset to assist with analysis and data discovery. A series of tasks were explored to identify relevant articles and help find answers to key scientific questions on a number of COVID-19 research topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "*An example result using this method is shown below for one of the task questions. For each task question, a highlights section is built with a summary of the results along with each matching article and each article's text matches.*\n",

    ">## Range of incubation periods for the disease in humans (and how this varies across age and health status) and how long individuals are contagious, even after recovery.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">#### Highlights<br/>\n",
    ">- The incubation period is generally 3-7 days (within 14 days) .<br/>\n",
    ">- We assume ν = 1/7, which means that the average period of infectiousness of asymptomatic infectious individuals is 7 days.<br/>\n",
    ">- We assume here that the latent period equals the incubation period, or the mean period of time between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms.<br/>\n",
    ">- After an incubation period of 5.6 days , 49% of infected people develop symptoms and become infectious while the remaining remain asymptomatic and do not transmit the disease further.<br/>\n",
    ">- The incubation period of 2019-nCoV is generally 3-7 days but no longer than 14 days, and the virus is infective during the incubation period.<br/>\n",
    ">\n",
    ">#### Articles<br/>\n",
    ">[Modeling the Comparative Impact of Individual Quarantine vs. Active Monitoring of Contacts for the Mitigation of COVID-19](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031088)<br/>\n",

    ">*Mar 08, 2020*<br/>\n",
    ">- Depending on how much time has passed since exposure to the primary infected individual, those infected may not yet be symptomatic -this period of time between infection and symptoms is an important epidemiological trait of an >infectious disease called the incubation period.<br/>\n",
    ">- When , for .2 R 0 = 2 example, remains below one unless the onset of infectiousness precedes symptoms by R IQ more than two days while has little tolerance for presymptomatic infectiousness (Figure 4) .<br/>\n",
    ">- Upon infection, individuals progress through a latent period before onset of infectiousness; during the duration of infectiousness, the relative infectiousness follows a triangular distribution.<br/>\n"

    "# Build Embedding Index\n",
    "\n",
    "An embeddings index is created with [FastText](https://fasttext.cc/) + [BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25). Background on this method can be found in this [Medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-sentence-embedding-index-with-fasttext-and-bm25-f07e7148d240) and an existing repository using this method [codequestion](https://github.com/neuml/codequestion).\n",
    "\n",
    "The embeddings index takes each COVID-19 tagged section, tokenizes the text, and builds a sentence embedding. A sentence embedding is a BM25 weighted combination of the FastText vectors for each token in the sentence. The embeddings index takes the full corpus of these embeddings and builds a [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) index to enable similarity searching. \n",
