Match (0.5919): **The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus in December 2019 (COVID-19) has activated top-level response nationwide and has been classified as a public health emergency of international concern (PHIEC) by the World Health Organization (WHO). 1 By 24:00 on February 16, 2020, 70,548 confirmed cases, 10,644 severe cases, 1,770 deaths, and 546,016 close contact cases have been identified in 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps of China. 2 The SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia has rapidly spread from Wuhan to 21 other countries, including the United States, Japan, Italy and Germany 3, 4 , demonstrating high levels of infectivity and pathogenicity. [5] [6] [7] The fever clinic of Tongji hospital in Wuhan has been the center of this outbreak. During the early phase of this outbreak, a large number of patients poured into the fever clinic, which far exceeded the medical resources that the hospital could equip. The medical staff were obviously insufficient to cope with it, and were prone to a wide range of cross-infection between doctors and patients. Based on this situation many patients had to be quarantined at home due to objective reasons and could not receive effective medical guidance. Therefore, we developed a new treatment method based on the online-to-offline (O2O) business model 8 for close contact, suspected (currently known as clinical diagnosis) and confirmed patients that were under quarantine. We developed a medical observation scale according to the patients' first symptoms and new symptoms which can be filled out by the patients on their smartphones or computers. Our online multidisciplinary team (medicine, rehabilitation, psychology and nursing) can then provide guidance and advice for patients based on the subjective changes in their symptoms. This method ensures that the patients follow an orderly treatment-seeking strategy that begins from their home and extends to the community and finally to the hospital. Our strategy not only helps relief the problem of scarce medical resources and reduce unnecessary cross-infection in hospitals, but it also increases people's self-management ability and cooperation and encourages them to participate in health monitoring. In addition, in accordance with the guidelines of home care for isolation patients issued by WHO 9 , the infection of family members was not increased during the strict self-isolation at home in this study.**<br/>

Many cities in China have been imposing a lockdown, due to the high risk of infection and the characteristic of human-to-human transmission 1 . Not only have patients been marginalized, but many clinicians working in the regional hospitals have limited access to the specialist consultations and treatment guidelines they need from provincial-level hospitals to manage pneumonia cases caused by COVID-19.

It was not appropriate to treat 2019-nCoV-infected patients in the central area because the large stream of people would have a negative impact on infection control measures to curb the spread of the infection. The hospital authorities decided to vacate 402 beds belonging to the Center of Infectious Disease and the adjacent Fifth Inpatient Building so that both are separated from the rest of the inpatient buildings in WCH (Supplementary Figure 1) . Based on the initial data [1, 2] and taking into consideration the surge of critically ill patients, we plan to equip 50 ICU beds initially and adjust on the number of patients, as necessary. We made a list of requirements for other special medical equipment, such as ventilators, bronchoscopes, hemodialysis machines, ultrasound machines, standard personal protective equipment (PPE), and sterilizing equipment. During this epidemic period, a large amount of certified PPE, including medical masks, goggles, face shields, and waterproof isolation gowns, is required. Manufactures of the items on the requirement list were contracted and we drew up an advertisement to the society calling for donations to ensure sufficient supplies.**<br/>

First, 63 severe cases and 591 patients with mild and moderate respiratory infections received telemedicine consultations through the ETCS between January 28, 2020 and February 17, 2020. As of February 17, 2020, 420 cases had been cured and discharged from the hospitals. Second, in the isolation wards, the mobile telemedicine device effectively collects, transforms, and evaluates patient health data such as blood pressure, oxygen level, and respiratory rate, and reports them to the care team. This facilitates the avoidance of direct physical contact, thus reducing the risk of exposure to respiratory secretions and preventing the potential transmission of infection to physicians and nurses. Third, the specialist treatment team includes specialists from different clinical disciplines, and can therefore offer comprehensive assessment and treatment. Meanwhile, nurse care managers and social workers can be involved strategically to help patients with pneumonia obtain post-treatment care to avoid coronavirus re-infection. Fourth, the specialist treatment team provides primary care guidance on coronavirus (e.g., clinical criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis, patient transfers, and cleaning process) to all physicians and nurses at 126 connected hospitals via video conference. Substantial efforts are devoted to training physicians and nurses, many of whom are new to the treatment of coronavirus infections. Figure 2 .

Match (0.6805): **In conclusion, there are a number of urgent research priorities to inform the public health response to the global spread of 2019-nCoV infections. Establishing robust estimates of the clinical severity of infections is probably the most pressing, because flattening out the surge in hospital admissions would be essential if there is a danger of hospitals becoming overwhelmed with patients who require inpatient care, not only for those infected with 2019-nCoV but also for urgent acute care of patients with other conditions including those scheduled for procedures and operations. In addressing the research gaps identified here, there is a need for strong collaboration of a competent corps of epidemiological scientists and public health workers who have the flexibility to cope with the surge capacity required, as well as support from laboratories that can deliver on the ever rising demand for diagnostic tests for 2019-nCoV and related sequelae. The readiness survey by Reusken et al. in this issue of Eurosurveillance testifies to the rapid response and capabilities of laboratories across Europe should the outbreak originating in Wuhan reach this continent [23] .**<br/>

Besides, timely and effective communication with the public is essential to mitigate panic buying and anxiety in the population 27,28 . Furthermore, during a medical resource crisis, health disparity could be widened between specific population groups. Individuals of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to find themselves in a dilemma between the need to work in high-risk locations and the lack of protective equipment. In addition, market forces can drive the price up, preventing them from purchasing an adequate amount of protective equipment.**<br/>

Match (0.6107): **Since December 2019, Wuhan and gradually other places of China have experienced an outbreak of pneumonia epidemic caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, later named SARS-CoV-2). 1 The World Health Organization has declared the current outbreak of COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. As of 10:00 Feb 13, 2020, the epidemic has caused 1366 deaths out of 59 834 confirmed and 16 067 suspected cases. 2 Some unprecedented measures were taken to stop the spread of the virus including cancelling of gatherings, extending the Chinese New Year holidays, and limiting the number of people in public places (e.g. train stations and airports). The outbreak itself and the control measures may lead to widespread fear and panic, especially stigmatization and social exclusion of confirmed patients, survivors and relations, which may escalate into further negative psychological reactions including adjustment disorder and depression. [3] [4] [5] Sudden outbreaks of public health events always pose huge challenges to the mental health service system. Examples include the HIV/AIDS epidemic that captivated world attention in the 1980s and 1990s, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and 2003, the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009, the Ebola virus outbreak in 2013, and the Zika virus outbreak in 2016. 6 During these epidemics, the consequences on the psychosocial wellbeing of at-risk communities are sometimes largely overlooked, especially in the Ebola-affected regions, where few measures were taken to address the mental health needs of confirmed patients, their families, medical staffs or general population. 7 The absence of mental health and psychosocial support systems and the lack of well-trained psychiatrists and/or psychologists in these regions increased the risks of psychological distress and progression to psychopathology. 8 The lack of effective mental health systems added to the poverty in Sierra Leone and Liberia. 9 In China, the mental health service system has been greatly improved after several major disasters, especially the Wenchuan earthquake. In the process of dealing with group crisis intervention, various forms of psychosocial intervention services have been developed, including the intervention model of expert-coach-teacher collaboration after the Wenchuan earthquake 10 and the equilibrium psychological intervention on people injured in the disaster incident after the Lushan earthquake. 11 With the support for remote psychological intervention provided by the development of Internet technology, especially the widespread application of 4G or 5G networks and smartphones, we developed a new intervention model to handle the present COVID-19 public health event. This new model, one of West China Hospital, integrates physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers into Internet platforms.**<br/>

Match (0.5981): **As we look to the future of epidemic prevention and control, we believe that telemedicine systems have the potential to play a role in addressing emergencies and large-scale outbreaks in high uncertainty settings. As telemedicine has inevitably altered the traditional working relationships within the healthcare network, how to ensure high-quality communication among healthcare practitioners poses a significant challenge. As such, frequent, timely, accurate, and problem-solving focused communication among clinical staffs from hospitals at different levels in the healthcare system is essential to minimize the risk incurred in handling patients with possible COVID-19 infection 3 . However, we have found that high quality of communication is not always maintained during the telemedicine coordination. Therefore, a learning telemedicine system platform for coronavirus care was developed across connected hospitals, serving as the overarching authoritative source for diagnostic decision making and knowledge sharing for treatment. The platform could aggregate COVID-19 patient records across 126 connected hospitals and rapidly expand to enable open collaborations with key stakeholders such as government authorities, research institutions and laboratories. The lessons learned from this crisis can provide insights to guide public health institutions as they implement telemedicine to increase resilience to future epidemic outbreaks.**<br/>

Match (0.7019): **Finally, 6 of the 41 patients died. The clinical data of 99 confirmed patients from the same hospital demonstrated that 17 in 99 patients developed ARDS; among them, 3 received ECMO treatment, and 11 died. [4] Another study reported that 22 in 138 cases (16%) developed into ARDS and were admitted into the ICU, of which 4 received ECMO. [5] Rationale ECMO use has been increasing in severe respiratory and/or cardiac failure despite implementation of conventional care. This technology has been proven valuable in treating viral pneumonia during the pandemic influenza A H1N1 in 2009. [6] The epidemics caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 led to a fatality rate of up to 34.4%. [7] The therapeutic effect of ECMO should be considered in MERS, whose causes of death during the epidemics were predominantly refractory hypoxemia and multi-organ failure, similar to COVID-19. Alshahrani MS et al [8] reported 35 MERS-CoV infected patients who were critically ill with refractory hypoxemia (partial pressure of arterial oxygen [PaO 2 ]/fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO 2 ] <100 mm Hg), of which 17 had received venous-venous ECMO (VV-ECMO). Compared with that in patients receiving only conventional respiratory care, the fatality of those who had received ECMO was significantly lower (100% vs. 65%). Because the evidence for recovering from COVID-19 with ECMO is extremely limited so far, we can learn from the previous experiences in the treatment of similar severe viral pneumonia cases through retrospective literature review and data analysis.**<br/>

Match (0.5603): **Despite the numerous RCTs on ARDS in the last 30 years, there has been no significant reduction in ARDS mortality. ARDS caused by 2019-nCoV appears to be more severe than that observed routinely. In this outbreak of NCP, the majority of critically ill patients have been aged 50 years and above, with a large number of them aged 70-80 years. These patients often had underlying diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart diseases, with some having multiple underlying diseases. Therefore, we suggest that patients with an oxygenation index below 150 mmHg after being treated with non-invasive ventilation for 2 hours with an FiO 2 of 1.0 or a relatively high FiO 2 should receive endotracheal intubation as soon as possible to enable invasive ventilation. WHO' interim guidance also suggested that HFNC and NIV should only be used in selected patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure, and patients treated with either HFNC or NIV should be closely monitored for clinical deterioration. [7] If oxygenation index remains below 100 mmHg after invasive ventilation for 24 hours with high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in prone position, ECMO should be used promptly. This is consistent with the recommendations of Chinese Society of Extracorporeal Life Support. [9] The 5th edition of "Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol" also recommended that endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation should be performed promptly if the condition does not improve or even deteriorate within a short period of time (1 to 2 hours) when using HFNC or NIV, and in case invasive mechanical ventilation in prone position is ineffective, ECMO should be performed at the earliest if possible.

However, the alerting clinical parameters of cardiac injury after COVID-19 infection and the correlation between cardiac injury and the COVID-19 severity remains to be determined. In this retrospective, single-center study, we recruited 41 consecutive cases of COVID-19 patients admitted to Beijing Youan Hospital, China from Jan 21 to Feb 03, 2020. We selected the indicators, including heart rate (HR), Troponin I (TnI) and epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) observed on chest computed tomographic (CT) scan, that is high related to cardiac injury. Tachycardia, TnI elevation and a trend of lower threshold attenuation EAT density in CT scan have been observed in severe and critical patients. Our results suggested that main attentions should be paid on monitoring the high risk factors of arrhythmia and cardiac function, including HR, TnI, and radiographic feature, that is, EAT density, to protect the COVID-19 patients from cardiac injury.**<br/>

However, further evidence is urgently needed to assess the mechanism of cardiac damage in large-sample autopsy or biopsy studies. Previous studies have indicated that SARS-CoV can mediate MI and damage associated with the downregulation of the myocardial angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 system; this may be responsible for the myocardial dysfunction and adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with SARS, which has also been detected in COVID-19 patients. [19] [20] [21] [22] Until now, the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV has not been completely understood. Although full-genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis has shown that SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, the pathophysiological mechanism of cardiac infection or damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 needs to be further validated in future studies. 23 In our study, AMI usually occurred in COVID-19 patients with old age, underlying comorbidities, severe or critically severe NCP, and ARDS. Among 44,672 patients with confirmed COVID-19, as reported in the China CDC Weekly on Feb 11, 2020, approximately 31.2% patients were aged >60 years.

This would ensure that both healthcare professionals and the general populace are informed, protected and remain within the prescribed rules and regulations. As noted by the WHO [40] , the healthcare guidelines and regulatory practices are advanced to also ensure that the health risk in question is reduced together with its consequences. In the current era of technological advancement, such regulations and guidelines are paramount as they have potential to lead to positive or negative outcomes. The position of this paper is to advance that it now possible to integrate technologies like the use of smart devices through IoT networks and wearable devices, data from mobile apps and others to help users to share information with accredited and certified health professionals, and in this case, improve the outcomes for better cross disciplinary and more resilient protocols and policies.**<br/>

Within a week, CDC developed a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-approved real-time RT-PCR test that can diagnose 2019-nCoV respiratory samples from clinical specimens. On January 24, CDC publicly posted the assay protocol for this test (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/lab/index.html). On January 4, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization to enable emergency use of CDC's 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. To date, this test has been limited to use at CDC laboratories. This authorization allows the use of the test at any CDC-qualified lab across the country. CDC is working closely with FDA and public health partners, including the American Public Health Laboratories, to rapidly share these tests domestically and internationally through CDC's International Reagent Resource (https://www.internationalreagentresource.org/). In addition, CDC uploaded the genome of the virus from the first reported cases in the United States to GenBank, the National Institutes of Health genetic sequence database of publicly available DNA sequences (https://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). CDC also is growing the virus in cell culture, which is necessary for further studies, including for additional genetic characterization.

By doing this, it is expected that issues like burdens of collecting data, accuracy and other complexity that are experienced (when systems are fragmented) are reduced or eliminated altogether. The standardization can be achieved by, for example, ensuring that all the devices and systems are linked into a single network, like was done in the U.S., where all the surveillance of healthcare were combined into the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSH) [35] . The fact that cities are increasingly tuning on the concept of Smart Cities and boasting an increased adoption rate of technological and connected products, existing surveillance networks can be re-calibrated to make use of those new sets of databases.

Match (0.5317): **The above improvements in the healthcare sector can only be achieved if different smart city products are fashioned to support standardized protocols that would allow for seamless communication between themselves. Weber and Podnar Žarko [9] suggest that IoT devices in use should support open protocols, and at the same time, the device provider should ensure that those fashioned uphold data integrity and safety during communication and transmission. Unfortunately, this has not been the case and, as Vermesan and Friess [10] explain, most smart city products use proprietary solutions that are only understood by the service providers. This situation often creates unnecessary fragmentation of information rendering only a partial integrated view on the dynamics of the urban realm. With restricted knowledge on emergent trends, urban managers cannot effectively take decisions to contain outbreaks and adequately act without compromising the social and economic integrity of their city. This paper, inspired by the case of the COVID-19 virus, explores how urban resilience can be further achieved, and outlines the importance of seeking standardization of communication across and between smart cities.**<br/>

Match (0.5217): **Whilst strong epidemiology and surveillance systems are indispensable tools for the detection and monitoring of outbreaks and public health emergencies, strong primary care systems form the foundation of any emergency response. In the UK, primary care handles over 95% of all health system activity. WHO member states have repeatedly affirmed their commitment to developing their primary care systems with a view to training up community-based health professionals who are able to provide care across the spectrum of prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery. As the 'front door' of the health system, primary care professionals should be involved in planning and action for health emergency risk management. WONCA (the global professional body for family medicine) has actively championed the ways in which primary care can be supported to deliver care during population emergencies. National primary care bodies can coordinate with public health leads to cascade information to practitioners, communicate with the public, and collate health intelligence from the frontline primary care. 8 The Ebola crisis taught us a valuable lesson about what happens when an outbreak takes health workers away from core functions to focus on crisis response; the number of people who died from reduced access to usual care probably exceeded the number killed by the virus. 9 Strong health systems built on comprehensive primary care are able to integrate both functions, disseminating the emergency response resources and information required to community-level staff who have the breadth of training required to manage new suspected cases alongside routine family medicine. Decent access to primary health care is essential in health emergencies, and its infrastructure crucial for containment, 10 just as good access to high-quality primary care is at the foundation of any strong health system. 11**<br/>

(2) Secondary protection (advanced protection for dental professionals). Wearing disposable doctor cap, disposable surgical mask, protective goggles, face shield, and working clothes (white coat) with disposable isolation clothing or surgical clothes outside, and disposable latex gloves. (3) Tertiary protection (strengthened protection when contact patient with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection). Although a patient with 2019-nCoV infection is not expected to be treated in the dental clinic, in the unlikely event that this does occur, and the dental professional cannot avoid close contact, special protective outwear is needed. If protective outwear is not available, working clothes (white coat) with extra disposable protective clothing outside should be worn. In addition, disposable doctor cap, protective goggles, face shield, disposable surgical mask, disposable latex gloves, and impermeable shoe cover should be worn.**<br/>

Match (0.5640): **To achieve higher efficacy of the public health interventions, efforts from individuals should not be neglected. In light of no available specific vaccines and treatments for such novel coronavirus thus far, a range of precautionary behaviours between individuals at homes and in communities are essential and vital to obtain proper control of the spreads in public and likely preventing superspreading events. Personal prevention strategies for seasonal influenza and other viral infections are still applicable during the present outbreak, inclusive of restricting ill residents from common activities, excluding symptomatic persons from entering homes/facilities, limiting visit especially of wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. Maintaining personal hygiene (e.g., frequently performing hand hygiene, washing hands with soap and water) and cough etiquette (e.g., covering nose and mouth when coughing, correctly disposing wasted tissues after coughing) are also beneficial. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.27.922443 doi: bioRxiv preprint Amongst these preventive practices, facemask wear appears to be the most operationalised and thus effective since it is observable from other members of the public. A recent cluster randomised controlled trial [16] , consisting of multiple region-varying medical settings, showed both N95 respirators and medical masks can effectively prevent influenza and other viral respiratory infections. Apart from facemask wear being required in public of the epicentre city in Hubei province, it has also been mandated by the Guangdong provincial government that facemasks should be worn in public with effect from 26 th January, four days after the implementation in Wuhan. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States, also emphasised the importance of wearing a facemask at all times when staying with infected individuals in shared spaces as one of precautions for large-scale spreads in community, specified in their interim guidance for prevention for 2019-nCoV from spreading in home and communities [17] . All these are extremely important in raising awareness in the public as to personal preventive steps given the present situation (mild or subclinical symptoms observed in many cases and observed long incubation period).**<br/>

Match (0.6357): **As we look to the future of epidemic prevention and control, we believe that telemedicine systems have the potential to play a role in addressing emergencies and large-scale outbreaks in high uncertainty settings. As telemedicine has inevitably altered the traditional working relationships within the healthcare network, how to ensure high-quality communication among healthcare practitioners poses a significant challenge. As such, frequent, timely, accurate, and problem-solving focused communication among clinical staffs from hospitals at different levels in the healthcare system is essential to minimize the risk incurred in handling patients with possible COVID-19 infection 3 . However, we have found that high quality of communication is not always maintained during the telemedicine coordination. Therefore, a learning telemedicine system platform for coronavirus care was developed across connected hospitals, serving as the overarching authoritative source for diagnostic decision making and knowledge sharing for treatment. The platform could aggregate COVID-19 patient records across 126 connected hospitals and rapidly expand to enable open collaborations with key stakeholders such as government authorities, research institutions and laboratories. The lessons learned from this crisis can provide insights to guide public health institutions as they implement telemedicine to increase resilience to future epidemic outbreaks.**<br/>

Match (0.6198): **Furthermore, in cases of emergencies like the current outbreak of COVID-19 and any other, the need for observance of regulatory practices and international healthcare guidelines are paramount. This would ensure that both healthcare professionals and the general populace are informed, protected and remain within the prescribed rules and regulations. As noted by the WHO [40] , the healthcare guidelines and regulatory practices are advanced to also ensure that the health risk in question is reduced together with its consequences. In the current era of technological advancement, such regulations and guidelines are paramount as they have potential to lead to positive or negative outcomes. The position of this paper is to advance that it now possible to integrate technologies like the use of smart devices through IoT networks and wearable devices, data from mobile apps and others to help users to share information with accredited and certified health professionals, and in this case, improve the outcomes for better cross disciplinary and more resilient protocols and policies.**<br/>

Many cities in China have been imposing a lockdown, due to the high risk of infection and the characteristic of human-to-human transmission 1 . Not only have patients been marginalized, but many clinicians working in the regional hospitals have limited access to the specialist consultations and treatment guidelines they need from provincial-level hospitals to manage pneumonia cases caused by COVID-19.

To put this into perspective, it is believed that by the end of 2020, over 2314 exabytes (1 exabyte = 1 billion gigabytes) of data will be generated globally [12] from the health sector. Stanford Medicine [12] acknowledges that this increase, especially in the medical field, is witnessing a proportional increase due to the increase in sources of data that are not limited to hospital records. Rather, the increase is being underpinned by drawing upon a myriad and increasing number of IoT smart devices, that are projected to exponentially increase the global healthcare market to a value of more than USD $543.3 billion by 2025 [13] . However, while the potential for the data market is understood, such issues like privacy of information, data protection and sharing, and obligatory requirements of healthcare management and monitoring, among others, are critical. Moreover, in the present case of the Coronavirus outbreak, this ought to be handled with care to avoid jeopardizing efforts already in place to combat the pandemic.

Therefore, it becomes paramount to ensure that the measures taken to contain a virus transcend nationalist agendas where data and information sharing is normally restricted, to a more global agenda where humanity and global order are encouraged. With such an approach, it would be easier to share urban health data across geographies to better monitor emerging health threats in order to provide more economic stability, thereby ensuring no disruptions on such sectors like tourism and travel industries, amongst others. This is possible by ensuring collaborative, proactive measures to control outbreak spread and thus, human movements. This would remove fears on travelers, and would have positive impacts upon the tourism industry, that has been seen to bear the economic brunt whenever such outbreaks occur. This can be achieved by ensuring that protocols on data sharing are calibrated to remove all hurdles pertaining to sharing of information. On this, Lawpoolsri et al.

The first problem-reluctance to share primary data-has its roots in the fact that the ultimate reward for research efforts is a highly cited publication. As a result, individual researchers are naturally averse to sharing primary data prior to manuscript acceptance. The second issue-underutilization of existing, community supported tools and analysis frameworks-may be due to the lack of sustained efforts to educate the biomedical community about best practices in (genomic) data analysis. Such efforts exist (e.g., [16] ) but have difficulties reaching a wide audience because prominent scientific publication outlets are reluctant to accept data analysis tutorials or reviews. Yet the only way to improve accessibility and reproducibility of biomedical research is through dissemination of best analysis practices.**<br/>

Match (0.6001): **Woods: It is safe to exercise during the coronavirus outbreak. One should not limit the multitude of health benefits that exercise provides us on a daily basis just because there is a new virus in our environment. However, there may be some additional precautions to reduce your risk of infection. If you are a "social exerciser", you might want to limit your exposure to exercise partners who have exhibited signs and symptoms of illness. The problem, though, is that infected people may be infectious before they exhibit symptoms. In some instances, wearing a mask while exercising may be a way to reduce your exposure. It is very important to make sure that if you are exercising on equipment in fitness facilities or gymnasiums that you make sure to disinfect the equipment before and after you use it. When done exercising, the most effective way to clean hands is to wet them with clean water, then apply soap and scrub for at least 20 s, before rinsing and drying with a clean towel. Hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol content may also be used, but the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns they are not effective against all germs. This strategy should be used at all times, not just because there is an acute viral outbreak. Avoiding touching your face and neck with your hands is also advised if you cannot disinfect them until a later time.**<br/>

Match (0.5839): **Woods: It is safe for sedentary individuals to exercise or to start an exercise program. Physician consultation and approval may be needed for people with disease, comorbidity, orthopedic problems, or advanced age. As above, there are prudent precautions that can be taken to limit infectious disease spread. Anything that increases your probability of coming into contact with an infected person, or that compromises your immune system, increases your risk of infection. If you are sedentary, it may be a good idea not to overdo it. Research suggests that unaccustomed strenuous or prolonged exercise might reduce the function of your immune system defenses. As such, avoiding long and stressful exercise sessions that you are unaccustomed to might be a good idea.**<br/>

Match (0.5282): **Woods: Yes, I get many inquiries from Chinese and other international students about potentially working in my laboratory as a pre-doctoral student. The main advice that I would give these students is to make sure that you have (a) a strong academic record that includes basic science courses (i.e., chemistry, physiology), (b) evidence of basic science wet laboratory skills, and (c) tangible research output (i.e., abstracts, publications, and presentations) in your field. I would also caution about using cold call e-mails that do not reflect careful thought and research relative to the individual you are contacting. You should read the work and understand the research interests of the professor you are contacting while also making a case that you have strong interests and skills in this area. Most of the Chinese scholars I have mentored came to me on recommendation from someone I know and trust (e.g., another U.S. or international professor or student). Thus, it is important to create a network of people in your field of interest. You can do this by interacting with people at scientific meetings. If that is not an option due to cost or circumstance, I would recommend trying to find any connection between you, your institution, or your current mentor and someone at a target institution of study. As for manuscripts coming from Chinese or international laboratories submitted to English-language journals, my recommendation would be to make sure that the manuscript has been carefully edited for spelling and grammar relative to the English language. No matter how good the science is, if the presentation is poor it will reflect poorly on the work.**<br/>

Match (0.5570): **Because of no effective antiviral drug for COVID-19 available, symptomatic and supportive treatments are rather crucial. Many patients were applied with other antiviral and antipyretic drugs. However, both antiviral drugs and acetaminophen have adverse reactions, such as liver function injury. [24] [25] [26] Previous studies have not further analyzed whether these patients with abnormal liver function are caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection or by the drugs used. In this study, the drugs used by patients before admission are mainly antibacterial drugs (including moxifloxacin, cephalosporins), antiviral drugs (abidol, oseltamivir, acyclovir), and antipyretic drugs with acetaminophen. We analyzed the prehospital medications of the two groups and found that there is no statistical difference between the two groups. Therefore, we speculated that the liver function damage of COVID-19 patients is closely related to virus infection. In addition, the proportion of male patients with liver damage was large, and the specific mechanism was unclear. The body temperature of patients with liver damage was significantly higher than that of the control group, which may be related to the immune response after virus infection.**<br/>

Secondly, consecutive detection of cytokines was lacking, which fail to truly monitor the severity of CRS.

Match (0.5470): **Based on the experience and lessons learned from the SARS and MERS outbreaks, the treatment site and protocol for confirmed cases of NCP are decided by disease severity: patients with mild symptoms (ie, coughing, low-grade fever, runny nose, and asymptomatic sore throat) are quarantined at home, whereas patients with moderate or severe disease are hospitalized for treatment. Our study cohort included only patients who were already critically ill. As there is currently no effective drug against the 2019-nCoV, symptomatic treatment and respiratory support were provided. Since the large-dose glucocorticoids used in the treatment of SARS resulted in serious adverse reactions [18, 19] but did not effectively decrease the mortality rate of CoV infection, [20] [21] [22] we treated patients with low-dose (30-80 mg/day) and short-term (3-5 days) methylpredisolone to alleviate the pulmonary exudates and inhibit a systemic cytokine storm. Unfortunately, this treatment did not provide significant benefits. As an alternative, intravenous injection with g-immunoglobulin can be offered; however, more clinical data are required to determine the efficacy of this treatment. In the middle and late stages of the disease, patients often develop additional bacterial or even fungal infections; therefore, careful attention must be paid to the rational use of antibiotics. In addition to the aforementioned treatments, respiratory support should be provided as early as possible. In this cohort, different types of oxygen therapy were administered according to each patient's pulse oximetry oxygen saturation and oxygenation index. For most patients, early non-invasive ventilation could promote positive outcomes. Alternatively, for critically ill patients, invasive ventilation or even ECMO should be considered. To date, ECMO has been successfully used to resuscitate one critically ill patient infected with this new CoV. Several drugs have already been tested against the 2019-nCoV and relevant clinical observation studies have been initiated with encouraging preliminary results. In particular, research on anti-coronaviral drugs and vaccines should be a continuous priority. None of these currently tested treatments was used in our cohort of patients, and thus their efficacy remains unknown.**<br/>

Match (0.5356): **Up to now, no antiviral treatment has been recommended for coronavirus treatment except supportive care and organ support [5, 20] . In current clinical practice, arbidol was used as an antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, but the curative effect remains unclear. Other antiviral medications including remdesivir and lopinavir etc. are still being verified in clinical trials. Furthermore, use of intravenous immunoglobulin is recommended to enhance the ability of anti-infection for severely ill patients and steroids are recommended for patients with ARDS, for as short duration of treatment as possible [21] . In this study, 96.04% patients received antiviral therapy, 98.02% received antibacterial therapy. Use of glucocorticoid mainly depended on the severity of inflammatory response. In the early outbreak of COVID-19, all the non-survivors received oxygen inhalation therapy including high flow oxygen inhalation (77.23%), but quite a low proportion of patients received machine ventilation partly due to limited medical resources against the steeply increasing number of patients.**<br/>

Match (0.5273): **The first strategy is to test existing broad-spectrum anti-virals 18 . Interferons, ribavirin, and cyclophilin inhibitors used to treat coronavirus pneumonia fall into this category. The advantages of these therapies are that their metabolic characteristics, dosages used, potential efficacy and side effects are clear as they have been approved for treating viral infections. But the disadvantage is that these therapies are too "broad-spectrum" and cannot kill coronaviruses in a targeted manner, and their side effects should not be underestimated. The second strategy is to use existing molecular databases to screen for molecules that may have therapeutic effect on coronavirus 19, 20 . High-throughput screening makes this strategy possible, and new functions of many drug molecules can be found through this strategy, for example, the discovery of anti-HIV infection drug lopinavir/ritonavir. The third strategy is directly based on the genomic information and pathological characteristics of different coronaviruses to develop new targeted drugs from scratch.**<br/>

Match (0.5179): **Appropriate antibiotic treatment can be administered to prevent secondary infection in critical type viral pneumonia. [19] We analyzed the diagnosis and treatment protocols of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, and results suggested that some patients undergoing antiviral treatment were also proactively undergoing antibacterial treatment. Whether viral pneumonia should be treated with glucocorticoids has been controversial. Some researchers believe that the use of glucocorticoids in viral pneumonia can easily aggravate the disease and increase the risk of secondary infections, leading to an increase in mortality, thus advocating against the use of glucocorticoids. [20] Other studies have suggested that the use of an appropriate dose of glucocorticoids at early stages could inhibit the elevated secretion of inflammatory cytokines due to excessive activation of immune cells because of the viral infection, thereby preventing continued exacerbation of lung injury . [21] We found that the combination of antivirals, antibacterials, and glucocorticoids had the highest use rate in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. Moreover, other researchers have suggested using thymosin and gamma globulin during the early stages of infection to improve patient immunity. In addition, current ongoing related studies suggest that COVID-19 and HIV have structural similarities.**<br/>

Here, as technological tools and laboratories around the world share data and collectively work to devise tools and cures, similar efforts should be considered between smart city professionals on how collaborative strategies could allow for the maximization of public safety on such and similar scenarios. This is valid as smart cities host a rich array of technological products [6, 7] that can assist in early detection of outbreaks; either through thermal cameras or Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, and early discussions could render efforts towards better management of similar situations in case of future potential outbreaks, and to improve the health fabric of cities generally. While thermal cameras are not sufficient on their own for the detection of pandemics -like the case of the COVID-19, the integration of such products with artificial intelligence (AI) can provide added benefits. The fact that initial screenings of temperature is being pursued for the case of the COVID-19 at airports and in areas of mass convergence is a testament to its potential in an automated fashion. Kamel Boulos et al. [8] supports that data from various technological products can help enrich health databases, provide more accurate, efficient, comprehensive and real-time information on outbreaks and their dispersal, thus aiding in the provision of better urban fabric risk management decisions.**<br/>

Match (0.7069): **As we look to the future of epidemic prevention and control, we believe that telemedicine systems have the potential to play a role in addressing emergencies and large-scale outbreaks in high uncertainty settings. As telemedicine has inevitably altered the traditional working relationships within the healthcare network, how to ensure high-quality communication among healthcare practitioners poses a significant challenge. As such, frequent, timely, accurate, and problem-solving focused communication among clinical staffs from hospitals at different levels in the healthcare system is essential to minimize the risk incurred in handling patients with possible COVID-19 infection 3 . However, we have found that high quality of communication is not always maintained during the telemedicine coordination. Therefore, a learning telemedicine system platform for coronavirus care was developed across connected hospitals, serving as the overarching authoritative source for diagnostic decision making and knowledge sharing for treatment. The platform could aggregate COVID-19 patient records across 126 connected hospitals and rapidly expand to enable open collaborations with key stakeholders such as government authorities, research institutions and laboratories. The lessons learned from this crisis can provide insights to guide public health institutions as they implement telemedicine to increase resilience to future epidemic outbreaks.**<br/>

Match (0.7027): **Whilst strong epidemiology and surveillance systems are indispensable tools for the detection and monitoring of outbreaks and public health emergencies, strong primary care systems form the foundation of any emergency response. In the UK, primary care handles over 95% of all health system activity. WHO member states have repeatedly affirmed their commitment to developing their primary care systems with a view to training up community-based health professionals who are able to provide care across the spectrum of prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery. As the 'front door' of the health system, primary care professionals should be involved in planning and action for health emergency risk management. WONCA (the global professional body for family medicine) has actively championed the ways in which primary care can be supported to deliver care during population emergencies. National primary care bodies can coordinate with public health leads to cascade information to practitioners, communicate with the public, and collate health intelligence from the frontline primary care. 8 The Ebola crisis taught us a valuable lesson about what happens when an outbreak takes health workers away from core functions to focus on crisis response; the number of people who died from reduced access to usual care probably exceeded the number killed by the virus. 9 Strong health systems built on comprehensive primary care are able to integrate both functions, disseminating the emergency response resources and information required to community-level staff who have the breadth of training required to manage new suspected cases alongside routine family medicine. Decent access to primary health care is essential in health emergencies, and its infrastructure crucial for containment, 10 just as good access to high-quality primary care is at the foundation of any strong health system. 11**<br/>

Besides, timely and effective communication with the public is essential to mitigate panic buying and anxiety in the population 27,28 . Furthermore, during a medical resource crisis, health disparity could be widened between specific population groups. Individuals of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to find themselves in a dilemma between the need to work in high-risk locations and the lack of protective equipment. In addition, market forces can drive the price up, preventing them from purchasing an adequate amount of protective equipment.**<br/>

The standardization can be achieved by, for example, ensuring that all the devices and systems are linked into a single network, like was done in the U.S., where all the surveillance of healthcare were combined into the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSH) [35] . The fact that cities are increasingly tuning on the concept of Smart Cities and boasting an increased adoption rate of technological and connected products, existing surveillance networks can be re-calibrated to make use of those new sets of databases.

Establishing durable international relationships that integrate diverse expertise is essential to delivering these outcomes. To this end, NHMRC has recently taken steps under the International Engagement Strategy 16 to increase cooperation with its counterparts overseas. These include the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED), tasked with translating the biomedical research output of that country. Given the reciprocal efforts at accelerating bilateral engagement currently underway, 17 the prospects for new areas of international cooperation and mobility have never been more exciting nor urgent. With the above in mind, all contributions to this CTI Special Feature I have selected from research presented by fellow invitees to the 2018 Awaji International Forum on Infection and Immunity (AIFII) and 2017 Consortium of Biological Sciences (ConBio) conferences in Japan. Both Australia and Japan have strong traditions in immunology and related disciplines, and I predict that the quantity, quality and importance of our bilateral cooperation will accelerate rapidly over the short to medium term.

As a result, individual researchers are naturally averse to sharing primary data prior to manuscript acceptance. The second issue-underutilization of existing, community supported tools and analysis frameworks-may be due to the lack of sustained efforts to educate the biomedical community about best practices in (genomic) data analysis. Such efforts exist (e.g., [16] ) but have difficulties reaching a wide audience because prominent scientific publication outlets are reluctant to accept data analysis tutorials or reviews. Yet the only way to improve accessibility and reproducibility of biomedical research is through dissemination of best analysis practices.**<br/>

Match (0.4928): **We believed that it is necessary to improve the quality of research and to the registered clinical research programmes in strict accordance with the guidelines for clinical trials 32- 35 . In addition, current clinical trials by different hospitals conducted spontaneously are not effectively organized and coordinated, so more scattered and disorderly. Some drugs that have not been tested in vitro or whose safety is of great concern are also being tested in clinical trials, which not only increase the risk of clinical trials, but also waste research resources. Hence, the National Administration of scientific research should strengthen their management and coordination and a small number of promising drugs, such as Remdesivir, should be prioritized for clinical trials and allowed to run smoothly.**<br/>

Match (0.7182): **Of note, as documented in a series of randomized clinical trials (RCT), low or physiologic dose of corticosteroids treatment did not reduce mortality from septic shock caused by primary lung infections, but it could bring clinical benefits to secondary outcomes, such as earlier reversal of shock, shorter duration to exit from ICU and mechanical ventilation 9, 10 . Besides, salvage corticosteroids treatment for severe patients with advanced ARDS could alleviate the pulmonary fibrosis and prevent progressive pathological deterioration 11 , which provides a good framework for explaining why some critical patients with SARS infection benefit from rescue corticosteroids therapy. More importantly, mortality benefit favored the severe HIN1-illness in the adjunctive treatment group with low dose of corticosteroids 12 . Evidently, all these results strongly suggest that proper use of low-dose corticosteroids may bring survival advantages for critically ill patients with 2019-nCoV, but this treatment should be strictly performed on NCP patients with definite clinical indications (such as refractory ARDS, sepsis or septic shock) according to the recommended guidelines.**<br/>

Match (0.7132): **Based on the experience and lessons learned from the SARS and MERS outbreaks, the treatment site and protocol for confirmed cases of NCP are decided by disease severity: patients with mild symptoms (ie, coughing, low-grade fever, runny nose, and asymptomatic sore throat) are quarantined at home, whereas patients with moderate or severe disease are hospitalized for treatment. Our study cohort included only patients who were already critically ill. As there is currently no effective drug against the 2019-nCoV, symptomatic treatment and respiratory support were provided. Since the large-dose glucocorticoids used in the treatment of SARS resulted in serious adverse reactions [18, 19] but did not effectively decrease the mortality rate of CoV infection, [20] [21] [22] we treated patients with low-dose (30-80 mg/day) and short-term (3-5 days) methylpredisolone to alleviate the pulmonary exudates and inhibit a systemic cytokine storm. Unfortunately, this treatment did not provide significant benefits. As an alternative, intravenous injection with g-immunoglobulin can be offered; however, more clinical data are required to determine the efficacy of this treatment. In the middle and late stages of the disease, patients often develop additional bacterial or even fungal infections; therefore, careful attention must be paid to the rational use of antibiotics. In addition to the aforementioned treatments, respiratory support should be provided as early as possible. In this cohort, different types of oxygen therapy were administered according to each patient's pulse oximetry oxygen saturation and oxygenation index. For most patients, early non-invasive ventilation could promote positive outcomes. Alternatively, for critically ill patients, invasive ventilation or even ECMO should be considered. To date, ECMO has been successfully used to resuscitate one critically ill patient infected with this new CoV. Several drugs have already been tested against the 2019-nCoV and relevant clinical observation studies have been initiated with encouraging preliminary results. In particular, research on anti-coronaviral drugs and vaccines should be a continuous priority. None of these currently tested treatments was used in our cohort of patients, and thus their efficacy remains unknown.**<br/>

Match (0.7108): **There is no fixed clinical guideline for the use of corticosteroids in critically ill patients in ICU. The anecdotal experience from SARS and sCAP therapy strongly supports precise corticosteroids management of NCP. Personalized medicine strategy should contain, but not limited to, specific indications, timing and duration, as well as therapeutic monitoring of corticosteroids therapy. As mentioned above, corticosteroids should be avoided unless there are indications for moderate or severe ARDS, sepsis or septic shock, in part consistent with the recommended clinical guidance from World Health Organization (WHO). We also do not suggest the use of corticosteroids for mild or early-stage ARDS, because early corticosteroids application could delay the clearance of virus and increase mortality risk, and corticosteroids are more likely to function on inflammation-mediated lung injury and interstitial fibro-proliferation at late-stage of ARDS 11 . Furthermore, clinical adverse complications in SARS patients with corticosteroids treatment have been reported to be dose-related. Over 240 mg of hydrocortisone-equivalent dose or an excessive cumulative dose was considered to be able to generate some side effects, including hyperglycemia, psychosis, and secondary infection, avascular necrosis 9, 10 . Hence, lower dose and short duration of corticosteroids treatment (methylprednisolone, <1 mg/kg body weight, no more than 7 days), along with adverse drug reaction monitoring, would be more beneficial in clinical management of critical patients with 2019-nCoV. In addition, a long-term follow-up (6 months to 3 years) is essential to identify delayed adverse effects in these patients. Of course, the optimal treatment strategy requires constant adjustment as patient's clinical performance changes.**<br/>

Furthermore, use of intravenous immunoglobulin is recommended to enhance the ability of anti-infection for severely ill patients and steroids are recommended for patients with ARDS, for as short duration of treatment as possible [21] . In this study, 96.04% patients received antiviral therapy, 98.02% received antibacterial therapy. Use of glucocorticoid mainly depended on the severity of inflammatory response. In the early outbreak of COVID-19, all the non-survivors received oxygen inhalation therapy including high flow oxygen inhalation (77.23%), but quite a low proportion of patients received machine ventilation partly due to limited medical resources against the steeply increasing number of patients.**<br/>
