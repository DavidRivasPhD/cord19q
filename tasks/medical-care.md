# Resources to support skilled nursing facilities and long term care facilities.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. [Remuzzi et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30627-9)<br/>
- Most health professionals working in isolation units and hospitals do not receive any training for providing mental health care. [Lima et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112915)<br/>
- The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced. [Yang et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30079-5)<br/>
- 8, 9 Further, extreme functional impairment within long-term care facilities makes close contact between health care workers and residents inevitable. [Dosa et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.03.004)<br/>
- For example, 35% of medical assistants and 31% of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aide households have child care obligations, while only 24% of emergency medical personnel have childcare obligations. [Bayham et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033415)<br/>

# Mobilization of surge medical staff to address shortages in overwhelmed communities

#### Highlights<br/>
- The current difficulty is the shortage of medical resources, especially critical care resources. [Liu et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021584)<br/>
- A great number of newly supplied medical resources (health workers and beds) enabled overwhelming patients to be treated effectively. [Zhang et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035410)<br/>
- During the early phase of the response in Wuhan, the number of patients overwhelmed local fever clinics and hospitals designated to receive COVID-19 patients. [Li et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033241)<br/>
- Also, this model could simulate multiple national public health responses including: 1) lockdown of the traffic in one city, 2) the hospital bed shortage as well as the amelioration in the medical system when multiple converted hospitals are available, and 3) the temporary public gathering events. [qiu et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.20032995)<br/>
- Despite the considerable medical resources and personnel that have been dispensed to combat COVID-19 in Hubei province, hospital capacity continues to be overburdened. [Lin et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022277)<br/>

# Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) outcomes data of COVID-19 patients

#### Highlights<br/>
- In Huang's study , four (10%) patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation, and two received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). [Yang et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102434)<br/>
- Intensive care, ventilation and ECMO may be used for severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. [MacIntyre et al](https://doi.org/10.31646/gbio.50)<br/>
- In addition, 48 (87.3%) of severe patients developed ARDS, and 10 (18.2%) of them were treated with IMV plus ECMO support and 2 AKI patients underwent CRRT. [Zhang et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.20030452)<br/>
- Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is potentially of benefit and we will know more particularly when cities with higher technology health systems become affected and ECMO is truly tested in the most severely ill. ECMO is currently being used in China, however, its effectiveness is yet to be determined. [Fisher et al](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-020-01533-w)<br/>
- Alshahrani MS et al reported 35 MERS-CoV infected patients who were critically ill with refractory hypoxemia (partial pressure of arterial oxygen [PaO 2 ]/fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO 2 ] <100 mm Hg), of which 17 had received venous-venous ECMO (VV-ECMO).

# Application of regulatory standards (e.g., EUA, CLIA) and ability to adapt care to crisis standards of care level.

#### Highlights<br/>
- A diagnostic virology laboratory must be set up to meet biosafety level 2 (BSL2) standards or above. [Artika et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104215)<br/>
- Last, our standards require health care organizations to have a plan for dealing with a surge of infectious patients. [Baker et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcjq.2020.03.001)<br/>
- In the absence of a harmonized triage procedure, there is the risk of increasing the workload for MAHs and Regulatory Authorities to manage shortages with a low impact on public health, even though they are already mitigated and managed effectively at dispensing level. [Musazzi et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171)<br/>
- In 2019, the EMA and HMA released two joint guidelines on shortages, which provided recommendations to improve the collaboration among Regulatory Authorities and stakeholders (EMA and HMA, 2019a,b) . [Musazzi et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171)<br/>
- The "Guidance on detection and notification of shortage of medicinal products for Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs) in the Union (EEA)" contained the first harmonized definition of shortage valid for all the EU (EMA and HMA, 2019a).

|2020-04-15|Musazzi et al|[New regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in Europe](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171)|According to the new regulatory provisions, the MAH should notify any shortages, including impending/anticipated supply interruptions, to the Regulatory Authorities of the affected European countries (EMA for medicinal products authorised by a centralised procedure).<br/><br/>To mitigate the risk of quality-failures, the EMA promoted the application of the quality-by-design and quality risk assessment principles to the manufacturing of medicinal products (EMA, 2015a (EMA, ,b, 2017 .<br/><br/>The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a medicine shortage.<br/><br/>Current regulatory framework and problems till on the ground According to Article 81 of the Directive 2001/83/EC, MAHs and their distributors should ensure appropriate and continued supplies to pharmacies and authorized persons to meet the needs of patients in the different European countries.<br/><br/>In the absence of a harmonized triage procedure, there is the risk of increasing the workload for MAHs and Regulatory Authorities to manage shortages with a low impact on public health, even though they are already mitigated and managed effectively at dispensing level.<br/><br/>In this context, MAHs may not be able to fulfil appropriately the guidance reported in the ISPE drug shortage prevention plan as suggested by the last HMA/ EMA guideline (EMA and HMA, 2019a) .<br/><br/>The second HMA/EMA guideline, "Good practice guidance for communication to the public on medicines' availability issues", aimed to enhance and align the European communication on a shortage to improve the awareness of healthcare professionals and patients and the cooperation among European stakeholders (EMA and HMA, 2019b).<br/><br/>In 2019, the EMA and HMA released two joint guidelines on shortages, which provided recommendations to improve the collaboration among Regulatory Authorities and stakeholders (EMA and HMA, 2019a,b) .<br/><br/>In this context, following the example of the provision adopted by several National Authorities to ensure patient access to immunoglobulins treatment (e.g., France, Germany, UK), the establishment of treatment priority rankings, clinical practice guidelines and clinical records may be possible solutions.<br/><br/>The "Guidance on detection and notification of shortage of medicinal products for Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs) in the Union (EEA)" contained the first harmonized definition of shortage valid for all the EU (EMA and HMA, 2019a).<br/><br/>Indeed, especially for old medicinal products, the costs of the upgrade to the required high-quality standards and risk assessment plan may be too high to maintain the MAH economic sustainability.<br/><br/>Although the proposed definition was relevant only for Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs) and Regulatory Authorities, it is the first step to promote the communication and the coordination among European pharmaceutical stakeholders, regulators and professionals working in the different National Healthcare Systems for improving their resilience to shortages.<br/><br/>However, restriction criteria for medicines affected by shortage are not harmonized at the EU level.<br/><br/>Recommendations how to better communicate shortages to patients were introduced by the last HMA/ EMA guideline (EMA and HMA, 2019b) .<br/><br/>For multi-country shortages, the EMA's scientific committees should also be involved to write harmonized recommendations to healthcare professionals.<br/><br/>Economic incentives to MAHs producing medicinal products can be provided as cut-off of the regulatory costs/times to implement the quality in their manufacturing process and to improve their resilience to production blockage.<br/><br/>The data needed for each level are either available to competent National Authorities or included in the notification the MAHs have to send them for any expected/ongoing shortages according to the guideline for MAHs (EMA and HMA, 2019a).<br/><br/>For such products, manufacturer's resilience should be improved by more onerous provisions, such as the obligation for MAHs to qualify at least two suppliers of drug substance, the stockpiles' expansion and the implementation of the manufacturing technologies and risk assessment tools.|

# Approaches for encouraging and facilitating the production of elastomeric respirators, which can save thousands of N95 masks.

#### Highlights<br/>
- If respirators are not available, then masks should be used. [Chughtai et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103567)<br/>
- Laboratory workers must wear the required personal protective equipment including long sleeved gowns, gloves, eye protection, and N95 masks. [Artika et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104215)<br/>
- Strong 10 N95 masks should be worn in the same room with patients (preferred strategy). [Jin et al](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40779-020-0233-6)<br/>
- Disposable medical or surgical masks are common types of face masks used by both health workers and general public. [Chughtai et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103567)<br/>
- In our study, we found N95 respirators, disinfection and hand washing can help to reduce the risk of 2019-nCoV infection in medical staffs. [Wang et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.20021881)<br/>

# Guidance on the simple things people can do at home to take care of sick people and manage disease.

#### Highlights<br/>
- But to make confident predictions, they need to know much more about how easily the virus spreads, how sick it makes people, and whether infected people with no symptoms can still infect others. [Kupferschmidt et al](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.367.6478.610)<br/>
-  if the suspected patients do not get improvement in the symptoms or even worsened in condition during home care, they need to go to the doctor for treatment. [Jin et al](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40779-020-0233-6)<br/>
- If doctors, especially non-infective or respiratory doctors, do not pay great attention to the patient when they are receiving patients, and take good care of them, they may easily cause their own infection. [CHEN et al](None)<br/>
- Good risk communication allows people to know from trusted sources in real-time the risks they may face, and any protective measures they can take to help minimise this. [Rodríguez-Morales et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101578)<br/>
- But these figures may overlook tens of thousands of people with mild disease—say, a sore throat or a low-grade fever—who never seek medical care and may not even know they were infected with 2019-nCoV. [Kupferschmidt et al](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.367.6478.610)<br/>

# Use of AI in real-time health care delivery to evaluate interventions, risk factors, and outcomes in a way that could not be done manually.

#### Highlights<br/>
- In order to optimize patient care and resource allocation during this pandemic, biomarkers are urgently needed for stratifying patients' risk and for actively monitoring illness severity. [Lippi et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.022)<br/>
- Clinical efficacy of NPPV: NPPV can reduce the rate of tracheal intubation; therefore, theoretically, it can significantly reduce the risk of infection of medical personnel during tracheal intubation and artificial airway management for COVID-19 pneumonia patients. [Xia et al](https://doi.org/10.1097/CM9.0000000000000761)<br/>
- Information is required that will help refine the risk assessment as the outbreak continues and ensure that patients are managed in the best possible way. [Heymann et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30184-7)<br/>
- 11 Additional studies will help in assessing for host risk factors for disease severity and mortality. [Zhang et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.02.014)<br/>
- For most patients, early non-invasive ventilation could promote positive outcomes. [Kui et al](https://doi.org/10.1097/CM9.0000000000000744)<br/>

# Best practices and critical challenges and innovative solutions and technologies in hospital flow and organization, workforce protection, workforce allocation, community-based support resources, payment, and supply chain management to enhance capacity, efficiency, and outcomes.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Health system capacity factors include the availability of treatment or vaccine, and the level of resources (both human, material, and financial) available for allocation. [Peters et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.02.023)<br/>
- Based on international experiences with pandemic control, the world should emphasize improving the system of emergency reserve medical supplies in the process of establishing and improving public health emergency response systems, and it should promote the establishment of international cooperative programs to jointly deal with public health emergencies of international concern in the future. [Wang et al](https://doi.org/10.5582/bst.2020.01043)<br/>
- The application of such a vast technical and operational set of interventions depends on countries' public health and laboratory infrastructures and resources. [Gilbert et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020792)<br/>
- On the other side, if the shortage impact of medicinal products on the public health is low, it is not reasonable to charge the MAHs with additional costs and, therefore, affect the economic sustainability for the implementation of quality assurance systems that may have a limited positive impact on the continuity of care. [Musazzi et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171)<br/>
- Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. [Remuzzi et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30627-9)<br/>

# Efforts to determine adjunctive and supportive interventions that can improve the clinical outcomes of infected patients (e.g. steroids, high flow oxygen)
#### Highlights<br/>
- 9 Oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, intravenous antibiotics and antiviral therapy were usually applied in clinical management, but presently there were no effective drugs for improving the clinical outcome of COVID-19, especially for severe cases. [Zhang et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028191)<br/>
- Attention should be paid to organ function in these critically ill patients and necessary protective measures, including mechanical ventilation, glucocorticoids, antivirals, symptomatic treatments, and anti-shock therapy. [Wang et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30558-4)<br/>
- Lack of effective antivirals, inadequate adherence to standard supportive therapy, and high-dose corticosteroid use might have also contributed to the poor clinical outcomes in some patients. [Zhou et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3)<br/>
- Treating patients with severe viral pneumonia, timely application of glucocorticoids and respiratory support therapy is essential, in combination with personalized treatment specific to each patient. [Liu et al](https://doi.org/10.1097/CM9.0000000000000775)<br/>
- Treatment is largely supportive, with regimens including antiviral therapy. [Columbus et al](https://doi.org/10.1080/08998280.2020.1731272)<br/>
