- 12 Despite caring for frail older residents, AL settings are not staffed or equipped to provide the type of care that nursing homes can provide.<br/>
- A key challenge to nursing home and assisted living (AL) facilities during any disaster scenario is the maintenance of adequate staffing levels.<br/>
- This may be challenging in the nursing home environment, where supplies of these items may be limited and are prioritized for acute care hospitals.<br/>
- Several epidemiological variables make long-term care facilities a priority area for near term public health planning.<br/>

-  If oxygenation index remains below 100 mmHg after invasive ventilation for 24 hours with high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in prone position, ECMO should be used promptly.<br/>
- Therefore, we suggest that patients with an oxygenation index below 150 mmHg after being treated with non-invasive ventilation for 2 hours with an FiO 2 of 1.0 or a relatively high FiO 2 should receive endotracheal intubation as soon as possible to enable invasive ventilation.<br/>

- According to the new regulatory provisions, the MAH should notify any shortages, including impending/anticipated supply interruptions, to the Regulatory Authorities of the affected European countries (EMA for medicinal products authorised by a centralised procedure).<br/>
- Although the proposed definition was relevant only for Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs) and Regulatory Authorities, it is the first step to promote the communication and the coordination among European pharmaceutical stakeholders, regulators and professionals working in the different National Healthcare Systems for improving their resilience to shortages.<br/>
- In this context, for justified public health reasons, the National Regulatory Authorities can adopt regulatory pathways to speed up the release of the marketing authorization (e.g., Art.<br/>
- At the same time, it can be useful for European Regulatory Authorities to assess the potential risks of shortage for a medicinal product since the obtaining of the marketing authorization, allowing them to establish preventive actions to improve MAH resilience and minimize risks for patients' health.<br/>
- For these products, more centralized coordination of the risk control strategies by the EMA and, consequently, a more efficient sharing of information among National Regulatory Authorities are needed to better mitigation of shortage impact at a national level and to fulfil the needs of all the patients.<br/>

*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- Current regulatory framework and problems till on the ground According to Article 81 of the Directive 2001/83/EC, MAHs and their distributors should ensure appropriate and continued supplies to pharmacies and authorized persons to meet the needs of patients in the different European countries.<br/>
- According to the new regulatory provisions, the MAH should notify any shortages, including impending/anticipated supply interruptions, to the Regulatory Authorities of the affected European countries (EMA for medicinal products authorised by a centralised procedure).<br/>
- To mitigate the risk of quality-failures, the EMA promoted the application of the quality-by-design and quality risk assessment principles to the manufacturing of medicinal products (EMA, 2015a (EMA, ,b, 2017 .<br/>
- For such products, manufacturer's resilience should be improved by more onerous provisions, such as the obligation for MAHs to qualify at least two suppliers of drug substance, the stockpiles' expansion and the implementation of the manufacturing technologies and risk assessment tools.<br/>
- Indeed, especially for old medicinal products, the costs of the upgrade to the required high-quality standards and risk assessment plan may be too high to maintain the MAH economic sustainability.<br/>
- Although the proposed definition was relevant only for Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs) and Regulatory Authorities, it is the first step to promote the communication and the coordination among European pharmaceutical stakeholders, regulators and professionals working in the different National Healthcare Systems for improving their resilience to shortages.<br/>
- In this context, MAHs may not be able to fulfil appropriately the guidance reported in the ISPE drug shortage prevention plan as suggested by the last HMA/ EMA guideline (EMA and HMA, 2019a) .<br/>
- In this context, for justified public health reasons, the National Regulatory Authorities can adopt regulatory pathways to speed up the release of the marketing authorization (e.g., Art.<br/>
- In the absence of a harmonized triage procedure, there is the risk of increasing the workload for MAHs and Regulatory Authorities to manage shortages with a low impact on public health, even though they are already mitigated and managed effectively at dispensing level.<br/>
- Economic incentives to MAHs producing medicinal products can be provided as cut-off of the regulatory costs/times to implement the quality in their manufacturing process and to improve their resilience to production blockage.<br/>
- The data needed for each level are either available to competent National Authorities or included in the notification the MAHs have to send them for any expected/ongoing shortages according to the guideline for MAHs (EMA and HMA, 2019a).<br/>
- The "Guidance on detection and notification of shortage of medicinal products for Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs) in the Union (EEA)" contained the first harmonized definition of shortage valid for all the EU (EMA and HMA, 2019a).<br/>
- At the same time, it can be useful for European Regulatory Authorities to assess the potential risks of shortage for a medicinal product since the obtaining of the marketing authorization, allowing them to establish preventive actions to improve MAH resilience and minimize risks for patients' health.<br/>
- In 2019, the EMA and HMA released two joint guidelines on shortages, which provided recommendations to improve the collaboration among Regulatory Authorities and stakeholders (EMA and HMA, 2019a,b) .<br/>
- Since fees and times for dossier variations vary significantly among the European Regulatory Authorities (EGA, 2015) , the extent of the regulatory incentives cannot be defined a priori at EU-level, but they should be calculated as percentages of current fee and regulatory time to be more adaptable to the different National settings (Fig.<br/>
- The second HMA/EMA guideline, "Good practice guidance for communication to the public on medicines' availability issues", aimed to enhance and align the European communication on a shortage to improve the awareness of healthcare professionals and patients and the cooperation among European stakeholders (EMA and HMA, 2019b).<br/>
- In this context, following the example of the provision adopted by several National Authorities to ensure patient access to immunoglobulins treatment (e.g., France, Germany, UK), the establishment of treatment priority rankings, clinical practice guidelines and clinical records may be possible solutions.<br/>
- In this context, considerable efforts have been made from Regulatory Authorities and professional associations to improve the quality in the pharmaceutical processes to minimize the risk for the patients and improve the effectiveness of the manufacturing processes (ISPE, 2014; PDA, 2014; EMA, 2019c; Various Associations, 2019b) .<br/>
- For these considerations, the adoption of the preventing tools proposed by the stakeholders' associations (PDA, 2014; ISPE, 2014) could be carried out gradually by the MAHs based on both the shortage impact of a product on the treated patients and the economic sustainability for the MAHs production.<br/>
- For these products, more centralized coordination of the risk control strategies by the EMA and, consequently, a more efficient sharing of information among National Regulatory Authorities are needed to better mitigation of shortage impact at a national level and to fulfil the needs of all the patients.<br/>

- variable part of algorithm) can be built up according to the features of different settings (e.g., manufacturers, wholesalers, hospitals, pharmacies) or National regulatory frameworks.<br/>
- For multi-country shortages, the EMA's scientific committees should also be involved to write harmonized recommendations to healthcare professionals.<br/>
- The implementation of the quality risk management plan, including shortage-specific prevention and management plan, was proposed to enhance the resilience of manufacturers to shortages, (ISPE, 2014; PDA, 2014; Panzitta et al., 2017) .<br/>
- Therefore, proper harmonized decision trees should be designed to apply regulatory incentives only to the most vulnerable medicinal products to shortages.<br/>
- However, the kaleidoscopic regulatory framework on shortage is not the only critical factor, but the heterogenicity of the National legislation, reimbursement and price policies, and medicines' market around Europe limited the establishment of a solid European emergency plan to solve the shortage problem.<br/>

- In case of shortages, alternatives to respirators should be considered, including other classes of FFRs, elastomeric half-mask, and full facepiece air purifying respirators.<br/>
- After wearing the gown, it is recommended to proceed with the filtering face-piece (N95, FFP2 or FFP3) respirator; it is crucial to perform a fitting test after the equipment has been put on the face.<br/>
- In case of shortage of filtering face-piece respirators, the use of a surgical mask as substitution is recommended.<br/>
- Medical or surgical or facial masks are defined as loose-fitting, disposable devices that create a physical barrier between the mouth and nose of the wearer and potential contaminants in the immediate environment.<br/>
- Respirators, on the other hand, protect the wearer against potentially hazardous particles created by the work environment.<br/>
- PPE may include items such as gloves, goggles or face shield, gowns, and respiratory protective equipment .<br/>

- On this matter, community pharmacists in Macau were positioned to do three things: help consumers differentiate surgical masks from other types of face masks not made for protection against virus transmission; control the price of surgical masks within reasonable price range; and help implement "The Guaranteed Mask Supply for Macao Residents Scheme" in response to the new government policy.<br/>
- Unlike ordinary face masks, surgical masks were required to demonstrate their performance in terms of bacterial filtration efficiency, differential pressure, resistance to penetration by synthetic blood, sub-micron particulate filtration efficiency and/or flammability as stipulated in the WHO guideline and national standards.<br/>
-    The spreading of the new coronavirus infection inevitably drove demands for protective masks and community pharmacists should play a reliable gatekeeper in advising about the right choice and stocking the appropriate surgical masks for the intended purposes.<br/>

- She separates the power of experts to control the production of knowledge and engage with key policy actors from policy objectives themselves.<br/>
- Ideas and knowledge do not simply flow within the network, given that dominant paradigms and political, social and cultural norms privilege better established knowledge communities (Tchilingirian, 2018) .<br/>
- Whilst some of this material is openly available, a degree of insider knowledge is required to identify who the key actors were and the modes of their engagement.<br/>
- They have an authoritative claim to policy relevant expertise in a particular domain and Haas claims that policy actors will routinely place them above other interest groups in their level of expertise.<br/>
- Social scientists were most successful in engaging when they framed their expertise in terms of already widely accepted concepts, such as the need for better communications with communities.<br/>
- By analysing data pertaining to researchers' and policy professionals' participation in policy networks one can test assumptions around interdisciplinarity and identify powerful knowledge gatekeepers.<br/>
- Anthropologists with expertise in the region focused instead on engaging communities more constructively, managing stigma and understanding local behaviours and customs (Fairhead, 2014) , (Richards, 2014b) and (Berghs, 2014) .<br/>

[New regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in Europe](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171)<br/>
by Musazzi, Umberto M.; Di Giorgio, Domenico; Minghetti, Paola<br/>
*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- This manuscript aims to review the current upgrade of the European regulatory framework on medicine shortages and to propose a theoretical approach for 1) determining the shortage/unavailability impact on the capability of the National Healthcare Systems and 2) rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted in function of the leading cause of shortage (e.g., production, price and importation/exportation).<br/>
- The implementation of the quality risk management plan, including shortage-specific prevention and management plan, was proposed to enhance the resilience of manufacturers to shortages, (ISPE, 2014; PDA, 2014; Panzitta et al., 2017) .<br/>
- For mitigating shortages that affect the Union, the stronger coordination at EU-level and the harmonization of communication, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies are desirable and urgent.<br/>
- On the other side, if the shortage impact of medicinal products on the public health is low, it is not reasonable to charge the MAHs with additional costs and, therefore, affect the economic sustainability for the implementation of quality assurance systems that may have a limited positive impact on the continuity of care.<br/>
- However, effective pharmaceutical quality systems require close collaboration between the MAH and their suppliers of raw materials to promote a more rational definition of the critical quality attributes of the drug product and to improve the production resilience.<br/>
- Indeed, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies adopted by professionals (e.g., pharmacists) and other stakeholders can be rationalized and harmonized based on the medicines shortage impact scores calculated by a competent National Authority.<br/>
- Indeed, a unique triage procedure for shortage impacts can improve the stakeholders' cooperation in managing the emergencies.<br/>
- In this light, it should be flexible enough to rationalize the risk-assessment and risk-management strategies for the mitigation of the shortage effects in different industrial and healthcare settings.<br/>
- Although the proposed definition was relevant only for Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs) and Regulatory Authorities, it is the first step to promote the communication and the coordination among European pharmaceutical stakeholders, regulators and professionals working in the different National Healthcare Systems for improving their resilience to shortages.<br/>
- Consequently, in the estimation of the shortage impact on the patient needs, this aspect should be primary for harmonizing the existing metrics and rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted.<br/>
- The second HMA/EMA guideline, "Good practice guidance for communication to the public on medicines' availability issues", aimed to enhance and align the European communication on a shortage to improve the awareness of healthcare professionals and patients and the cooperation among European stakeholders (EMA and HMA, 2019b).<br/>

# Efforts to develop a core clinical outcome set to maximize usability of data across a range of trials

#### Highlights<br/>
- In all cases, our results are only as good as the training data used; high quality labels and sequences are needed to develop trustworthy models.<br/>
- Furthermore, the value of R 0 may vary with key clinical parameters inferred from data which depend on the time period, quality, accuracy, and reliability.<br/>
- Updating the parameters from recent data is needed to refine the near-casting, and to identify gaps in the intervention measures implemented to further improve them.<br/>
- Given such concerns, our strategy in the proposed model was to only use necessary data for analysis, and over the course of improved data quality in the near future, our toolbox may be extended to enjoy greater statistical power and more accurate predictions.<br/>
- This can lead to practical changes in management, which can improve allocative efficiency as well as clinical outcomes, through the consideration of more intensive environments of care All rights reserved.<br/>

- ), treatment measures (antibiotics agents, antiviral agents, traditional Chinese medicine, immune globulin, thymosin, corticosteroids and oxygen therapy), and complications (e.g.<br/>
- Treating patients with severe viral pneumonia, timely application of glucocorticoids and respiratory support therapy is essential, in combination with personalized treatment specific to each patient.<br/>
- Overall, oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, intravenous antibiotics and oseltamivir therapy were initiated in 38.0%, 6.1%, 57.5% and 35.8% of patients, respectively.<br/>
- The supportive treatment, including oxygen therapy, conservation fluid management, and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover secondary bacterial infection, remains to be the most important management strategy .<br/>
- Corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone 1-2 mg/kg/day) are recommended for severely ill patients with ARDS, for as short a duration of treatment as possible.<br/>
