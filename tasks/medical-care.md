- 12 Despite caring for frail older residents, AL settings are not staffed or equipped to provide the type of care that nursing homes can provide.<br/>
- A key challenge to nursing home and assisted living (AL) facilities during any disaster scenario is the maintenance of adequate staffing levels.<br/>
- This may be challenging in the nursing home environment, where supplies of these items may be limited and are prioritized for acute care hospitals.<br/>
- Several epidemiological variables make long-term care facilities a priority area for near term public health planning.<br/>
- In recent years, negative outcomes in nursing homes during disaster situations have led the media, public health officials, and politicians to find fault with nursing home providers.<br/>

- Although the proposed definition was relevant only for Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs) and Regulatory Authorities, it is the first step to promote the communication and the coordination among European pharmaceutical stakeholders, regulators and professionals working in the different National Healthcare Systems for improving their resilience to shortages.<br/>
- In this context, for justified public health reasons, the National Regulatory Authorities can adopt regulatory pathways to speed up the release of the marketing authorization (e.g., Art.<br/>
- According to the new regulatory provisions, the MAH should notify any shortages, including impending/anticipated supply interruptions, to the Regulatory Authorities of the affected European countries (EMA for medicinal products authorised by a centralised procedure).<br/>
- At the same time, it can be useful for European Regulatory Authorities to assess the potential risks of shortage for a medicinal product since the obtaining of the marketing authorization, allowing them to establish preventive actions to improve MAH resilience and minimize risks for patients' health.<br/>
- For these products, more centralized coordination of the risk control strategies by the EMA and, consequently, a more efficient sharing of information among National Regulatory Authorities are needed to better mitigation of shortage impact at a national level and to fulfil the needs of all the patients.<br/>

[New regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in Europe](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171)<br/>
by Musazzi, Umberto M.; Di Giorgio, Domenico; Minghetti, Paola<br/>
*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- The second HMA/EMA guideline, "Good practice guidance for communication to the public on medicines' availability issues", aimed to enhance and align the European communication on a shortage to improve the awareness of healthcare professionals and patients and the cooperation among European stakeholders (EMA and HMA, 2019b).<br/>
- Although the proposed definition was relevant only for Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs) and Regulatory Authorities, it is the first step to promote the communication and the coordination among European pharmaceutical stakeholders, regulators and professionals working in the different National Healthcare Systems for improving their resilience to shortages.<br/>
- Current regulatory framework and problems till on the ground According to Article 81 of the Directive 2001/83/EC, MAHs and their distributors should ensure appropriate and continued supplies to pharmacies and authorized persons to meet the needs of patients in the different European countries.<br/>
- In this context, for justified public health reasons, the National Regulatory Authorities can adopt regulatory pathways to speed up the release of the marketing authorization (e.g., Art.<br/>
- According to the new regulatory provisions, the MAH should notify any shortages, including impending/anticipated supply interruptions, to the Regulatory Authorities of the affected European countries (EMA for medicinal products authorised by a centralised procedure).<br/>
- In 2019, the EMA and HMA released two joint guidelines on shortages, which provided recommendations to improve the collaboration among Regulatory Authorities and stakeholders (EMA and HMA, 2019a,b) .<br/>
- In the absence of a harmonized triage procedure, there is the risk of increasing the workload for MAHs and Regulatory Authorities to manage shortages with a low impact on public health, even though they are already mitigated and managed effectively at dispensing level.<br/>
- To mitigate the risk of quality-failures, the EMA promoted the application of the quality-by-design and quality risk assessment principles to the manufacturing of medicinal products (EMA, 2015a (EMA, ,b, 2017 .<br/>
- Since fees and times for dossier variations vary significantly among the European Regulatory Authorities (EGA, 2015) , the extent of the regulatory incentives cannot be defined a priori at EU-level, but they should be calculated as percentages of current fee and regulatory time to be more adaptable to the different National settings (Fig.<br/>
- Indeed, especially for old medicinal products, the costs of the upgrade to the required high-quality standards and risk assessment plan may be too high to maintain the MAH economic sustainability.<br/>
- The "Guidance on detection and notification of shortage of medicinal products for Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs) in the Union (EEA)" contained the first harmonized definition of shortage valid for all the EU (EMA and HMA, 2019a).<br/>
- For such products, manufacturer's resilience should be improved by more onerous provisions, such as the obligation for MAHs to qualify at least two suppliers of drug substance, the stockpiles' expansion and the implementation of the manufacturing technologies and risk assessment tools.<br/>
- In this context, MAHs may not be able to fulfil appropriately the guidance reported in the ISPE drug shortage prevention plan as suggested by the last HMA/ EMA guideline (EMA and HMA, 2019a) .<br/>
- At the same time, it can be useful for European Regulatory Authorities to assess the potential risks of shortage for a medicinal product since the obtaining of the marketing authorization, allowing them to establish preventive actions to improve MAH resilience and minimize risks for patients' health.<br/>
- In this context, considerable efforts have been made from Regulatory Authorities and professional associations to improve the quality in the pharmaceutical processes to minimize the risk for the patients and improve the effectiveness of the manufacturing processes (ISPE, 2014; PDA, 2014; EMA, 2019c; Various Associations, 2019b) .<br/>
- For these products, more centralized coordination of the risk control strategies by the EMA and, consequently, a more efficient sharing of information among National Regulatory Authorities are needed to better mitigation of shortage impact at a national level and to fulfil the needs of all the patients.<br/>
- Economic incentives to MAHs producing medicinal products can be provided as cut-off of the regulatory costs/times to implement the quality in their manufacturing process and to improve their resilience to production blockage.<br/>
- Such an approach would be useful to the European Regulatory Authorities in the harmonization of the metrics around the Union.<br/>
- However, the kaleidoscopic regulatory framework on shortage is not the only critical factor, but the heterogenicity of the National legislation, reimbursement and price policies, and medicines' market around Europe limited the establishment of a solid European emergency plan to solve the shortage problem.<br/>
- variable part of algorithm) can be built up according to the features of different settings (e.g., manufacturers, wholesalers, hospitals, pharmacies) or National regulatory frameworks.<br/>
- In this context, the establishment of ad hoc agreements between European countries and MAH to conduct exceptional manufacturing activities in specific National sites can also be pursued.<br/>
- In this context, following the example of the provision adopted by several National Authorities to ensure patient access to immunoglobulins treatment (e.g., France, Germany, UK), the establishment of treatment priority rankings, clinical practice guidelines and clinical records may be possible solutions.<br/>
- For these considerations, the adoption of the preventing tools proposed by the stakeholders' associations (PDA, 2014; ISPE, 2014) could be carried out gradually by the MAHs based on both the shortage impact of a product on the treated patients and the economic sustainability for the MAHs production.<br/>
- New regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in Europe<br/>
- Such a procedure may be fully integrable with other existing and adopted strategies and, therefore, it may be an added value for both European Regulatory Authorities and other subjects involved in the National pharmaceutical distribution chains and healthcare systems (e.g., manufacturers, wholesalers, hospitals, pharmacies, insurance companies, regional healthcare Authorities).<br/>
- Recommendations how to better communicate shortages to patients were introduced by the last HMA/ EMA guideline (EMA and HMA, 2019b) .<br/>
- Indeed, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies adopted by professionals (e.g., pharmacists) and other stakeholders can be rationalized and harmonized based on the medicines shortage impact scores calculated by a competent National Authority.<br/>
- In the case of high-impact products, fast authorization procedures should also be adopted to speed up the importation from other EU (parallel imports) or extra-EU countries with similar pharmaceutical quality standards to the EU, from which the medicine can be exported without any ripple effect.<br/>
- Moreover, the structure of procedure and decision trees may be adapted and used as a model to build up risk-management strategies for local needs of a specific healthcare assistance setting (e.g., single hospital).<br/>

*Eurosurveillance - 2020*<br/>
- A questionnaire was designed to assess the capacity, quality and operational specifics related to 2019-nCoV diagnostics, as well as barriers against their implementation in laboratories that are part of the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC)-associated European expert laboratory network for emerging viral diseases (EVD-LabNet) and/or the European Reference Laboratory Network for Human Influenza (ERLI-Net).<br/>
- This rapid assessment of the readiness of EU/EEA laboratories for molecular detection of 2019-nCoV demonstrated a fast implementation of molecular diagnostics by the European specialised laboratory networks with a good geographical coverage for testing.<br/>
- To properly assess the actual capability of the laboratories to detect (sub)clinical 2019-nCoV cases and to provide directions for corrective actions, proficiency testing by external quality assessment (EQA) is essential and urgently needed.<br/>
- If the outbreak turns into a pandemic, specialised laboratories' efforts would refocus to reference activities like confirmatory testing, laboratory surveillance including virus characterisation, provision of reference materials and advice, while general testing for 2019-nCoV would shift to first-line hospital laboratories that currently do not have this capacity.<br/>

*Gastrointestinal Endoscopy - Mar 14, 2020*<br/>
- In case of shortages, alternatives to respirators should be considered, including other classes of FFRs, elastomeric half-mask, and full facepiece air purifying respirators.<br/>
- After wearing the gown, it is recommended to proceed with the filtering face-piece (N95, FFP2 or FFP3) respirator; it is crucial to perform a fitting test after the equipment has been put on the face.<br/>
- In case of shortage of filtering face-piece respirators, the use of a surgical mask as substitution is recommended.<br/>
- Medical or surgical or facial masks are defined as loose-fitting, disposable devices that create a physical barrier between the mouth and nose of the wearer and potential contaminants in the immediate environment.<br/>
- Respirators, on the other hand, protect the wearer against potentially hazardous particles created by the work environment.<br/>
- PPE may include items such as gloves, goggles or face shield, gowns, and respiratory protective equipment .<br/>
- More specifically the N95/FFP2/FFP3 respirator is a protective device designed to achieve a very close facial fit and extremely efficient filtration of airborne particles (up to 0.3 microns), that can be inhaled through the nose or mouth) and germs.<br/>

# Best telemedicine practices, barriers and faciitators, and specific actions to remove/expand them within and across state boundaries.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Financial power, hub positions in the global exchange networks, and information supply chains also enable authoritarian regimes to engage in comprehensive social penetration and manipulation of other societies.<br/>
- Closer collaboration between local animal and human health authorities within the current epidemic disease prevention programmes will provide educational and training opportunities to promote risk-mitigation knowledge, skills and best practice in local communities.<br/>

- Moreover, the development and diffusion of the mIoT must address the following unresolved issues: improve interoperability: the adoption of open standards must ensure that products from different manufacturers can communicate with each other; ensure that there is no leakage; and enhance the distribution network: sensors must communicate with services such as the Internet and wireless networks such that information can be relayed to remote health workers.<br/>
- These would be expected to include preparedness of equipment, staff and facilities based on learning from previous epidemics, clear public health information, relevant containment, surveillance, and reporting, and international cooperation among governments, health authorities, travel organisations and border control forces.<br/>

*Orbis - Mar 04, 2020*<br/>
- To delegitimize democracies and other universal human-rights regimes, authoritarian regimes seek to incite and amplify existing divisions in democratic societies by manipulating or faking the information that reaches them.<br/>
- Specifically, those great powers can utilize their hub positions to gather information or cut off financial and information flows, discover and exploit vulnerabilities, compel policy change, and deter unwanted actions.<br/>
- Financial power, hub positions in the global exchange networks, and information supply chains also enable authoritarian regimes to engage in comprehensive social penetration and manipulation of other societies.<br/>
- First, they rely on different ways to govern cross-Strait ties.<br/>
- 38 China has launched its social penetration operations through those channels, and two are most influential: religious networks established by local temples and quasiillegal organizations, and various "cross-Strait exchange groups."<br/>
- Dictatorships manipulate the information and destabilize democratic societies in order to show that democratic institutions and values, such as freedom and universal human rights, are no better than authoritarian ones in solving domestic disputes.<br/>
- The goal of the misinformation approach is to delegitimize Taiwan's democratic institutions and values.<br/>
- Authoritarian regimes usually exercise their sharp power through four types of social exchanges: cultural exchange programs, academic/think tank cooperation, media, and publishing.<br/>

- Thus cornered, Taiwan might push back in any of several ways that would not serve Beijing's interests, including by simply switching to a strategy-one consistent with international law and international political reality-that drops a focus on diplomatic ties in favor of stressing Taiwan's impressively broad and deep informal relations with many countries.<br/>
- What makes the recent round of switches different is that China is actively targeting, pressuring, and enticing Taiwan's remaining diplomatic allies as a way to coerce Tsai's government into accepting the "1992 Consensus" or adopting a more pro-China policy.<br/>
- Adopting and implementing these policies will probably not stop Beijing's quest to squeeze Taiwan's by poaching all of its diplomatic allies.<br/>

- Avoiding touching your face and neck with your hands is also advised if you cannot disinfect them until a later time.<br/>
- If that is not an option due to cost or circumstance, I would recommend trying to find any connection between you, your institution, or your current mentor and someone at a target institution of study.<br/>
- You can do this by interacting with people at scientific meetings.<br/>

- These drugs are, therefore, unlikely to reduce viral infectivity at tolerated doses, although they might reduce the host inflammatory response through JAK inhibition.<br/>
- All three are powerful anti-inflammatories that, as JAK-STAT signalling inhibitors, are likely to be effective against the consequences of the elevated levels of cytokines (including interferon-γ) typically observed in people with COVID-19· 2 Although the three candidates have similar JAK inhibitor potencies, a high affinity for AAK1 suggests baricitinib is the best of the group, especially given its once-daily oral dosing and acceptable side-effect profile.<br/>

[New regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in Europe](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171)<br/>
by Musazzi, Umberto M.; Di Giorgio, Domenico; Minghetti, Paola<br/>
*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- This manuscript aims to review the current upgrade of the European regulatory framework on medicine shortages and to propose a theoretical approach for 1) determining the shortage/unavailability impact on the capability of the National Healthcare Systems and 2) rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted in function of the leading cause of shortage (e.g., production, price and importation/exportation).<br/>
- Indeed, a unique triage procedure for shortage impacts can improve the stakeholders' cooperation in managing the emergencies.<br/>
- Indeed, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies adopted by professionals (e.g., pharmacists) and other stakeholders can be rationalized and harmonized based on the medicines shortage impact scores calculated by a competent National Authority.<br/>
- Although the proposed definition was relevant only for Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs) and Regulatory Authorities, it is the first step to promote the communication and the coordination among European pharmaceutical stakeholders, regulators and professionals working in the different National Healthcare Systems for improving their resilience to shortages.<br/>
- The implementation of the quality risk management plan, including shortage-specific prevention and management plan, was proposed to enhance the resilience of manufacturers to shortages, (ISPE, 2014; PDA, 2014; Panzitta et al., 2017) .<br/>
- For mitigating shortages that affect the Union, the stronger coordination at EU-level and the harmonization of communication, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies are desirable and urgent.<br/>
- On the other side, if the shortage impact of medicinal products on the public health is low, it is not reasonable to charge the MAHs with additional costs and, therefore, affect the economic sustainability for the implementation of quality assurance systems that may have a limited positive impact on the continuity of care.<br/>
- The second HMA/EMA guideline, "Good practice guidance for communication to the public on medicines' availability issues", aimed to enhance and align the European communication on a shortage to improve the awareness of healthcare professionals and patients and the cooperation among European stakeholders (EMA and HMA, 2019b).<br/>
- Consequently, in the estimation of the shortage impact on the patient needs, this aspect should be primary for harmonizing the existing metrics and rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted.<br/>
- In this light, it should be flexible enough to rationalize the risk-assessment and risk-management strategies for the mitigation of the shortage effects in different industrial and healthcare settings.<br/>
- However, effective pharmaceutical quality systems require close collaboration between the MAH and their suppliers of raw materials to promote a more rational definition of the critical quality attributes of the drug product and to improve the production resilience.<br/>
- Moreover, the promising results obtained by some National competent Authorities (e.g., AIFA) suggested that setting up cooperation schemes between administration and other stakeholders, fostering a responsible approach in managing crisis in medicines supply, also allowing, for instance, surveillance/verification programs that may represent rational and effective preventive strategies to monitor the activities of exporting wholesalers and distributors for reducing the risks of product unavailability.<br/>
