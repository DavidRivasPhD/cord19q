- 11, 12 Host factors associated with mortality in this outbreak were older age (>60 years), smoking history, pre-existing pneumonia, abnormal renal function, and comorbidity.<br/>
- DPP4 receptors are upregulated in the lungs of smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which might explain why patients with comorbid lung diseases are prone to severe illness.<br/>
- These factors include male sex, comorbid pre-existing illnesses (such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, cancer, chronic heart, lung, and kidney disease, and immunocompromised states), low serum albumin, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, concomitant infections, and positive plasma MERS-CoV RNA.<br/>
-        MERS-CoV causes more severe disease in people older than 60 years, and those with chronic comorbid diseases such as renal disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, immunosuppression, and diabetes.<br/>

*Viruses - 2020*<br/>
- There were 3 deaths among the pregnant women with SARS (maternal mortality rate of 30%) and no deaths in the non-pregnant group of infected women (P = 0.006).<br/>
- Pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV, a related coronavirus, appear to have increased morbidity and mortality when compared to non-pregnant women, suggesting that MERS-CoV could also lead to severe clinical outcomes in pregnancy.<br/>
-  reported the findings from 7 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV.<br/>
- Two women with SARS recovered and maintained their pregnancy but had infants with IUGR.<br/>
- Among the 5 women who presented after 24 weeks gestation, 4 had preterm deliveries (80%).<br/>
- As a result of the immunological changes that occur during pregnancy, women who are pregnant are included in this high-risk group.<br/>
- In the placentas of 2 women who were convalescing from SARS-CoV infection in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy the placentas were highly abnormal.<br/>
- The clinical outcomes among pregnant women with SARS in Hong Kong were worse than those occurring in infected women who were not pregnant .<br/>
- However, pregnant women should be considered to be at high risk for developing severe infection during this current outbreak of 2019-nCoV.<br/>
- In the case of 2 women who were convalescing from SARS-CoV infection during the 1st trimester of pregnancy, the placentas were found to be normal.<br/>
- During the 1957-1958 Asian flu epidemic, 10% of all deaths occurred in pregnant women, and their CFR was twice as high as that of infected women who were not pregnant .<br/>

- Urgent questions that need to be addressed promptly include whether pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia will develop distinct symptoms from non-pregnant adults, whether pregnant women who have confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia are more likely to die of the infection or to undergo preterm labour, and whether COVID-19 could spread vertically and pose risks to the fetus and neonate.<br/>
- On Feb 6, 2020, a neonate born to a pregnant woman with COVID-19 pneumonia tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection 36 h after birth.<br/>
- 14 Previous studies have already shown no evidence of perinatal SARS infection among infants born to mothers who developed SARS infection during pregnancy.<br/>
- The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those of non-pregnant adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.<br/>
- Neonate 4 had a birthweight of 1880 g and the pregnancy was complicated by pre-eclampsia.<br/>
- Future investigations of these issues and follow-up studies of pregnant women with COVID-19 infection, as well as neonates, will be necessary to ascertain the safety and health of mothers and babies exposed to SARS-CoV-2.<br/>
- Based on data from this small group of patients, there is currently no evidence of vertical transmission in pregnant women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in the third trimester.<br/>

# Socio-economic and behavioral factors to understand the economic impact of the virus and whether there were differences.

#### Highlights<br/>
- A main objective of this paper is to quantify the effect of various social and economic factors in mediating the transmission rates of the virus, which may help identify potential behavioral and socioeconomic risk factors for infections.<br/>
- As per our recent recommendations (Asmundson & Taylor, 2020) , more research is needed to understand how individual difference factors, including health anxiety, specifically impact behaviour in response to COVID-19.<br/>
- Vulnerability Index (IDVI) that was introduced as a synthetic metric to account for a broader set of factors, including descriptors of health care, public health, economic, demographic, disease dynamics, and political (domestic and international) conditions .<br/>
- Our results suggested that perceived risk and severity of the disease as well as information reliability were important factors associated with the psychological and behavioral responses.<br/>
- Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI) is a metric developed by the RAND Corporation to identify countries potentially most vulnerable to poorly controlled infectious disease outbreaks because of confluence of factors including political, economic, public health, healthcare, demographics, and disease dynamics.<br/>

- In this study, we aimed to investigate psychological and behavioral responses to the threat of COVID-19 outbreak and to examine public perceptions associated with the response outcomes in mainland China.<br/>
- Our results suggested that perceived risk and severity of the disease as well as information reliability were important factors associated with the psychological and behavioral responses.<br/>
- 14, 15 Behavioral changes are also associated with government involvement level, perceptions of diseases, and the stage of the outbreak, and these factors vary by diseases and settings.<br/>
- Perception factors associated with anxiety and behavioral responses Table 1 are controlled for.<br/>
- Therefore, the psychological and behavioral responses of the general population play an important role in the control of the outbreak.<br/>

# Transmission dynamics of the virus, including the basic reproductive number, incubation period, serial interval, modes of transmission and environmental factors

#### Highlights<br/>
- We estimated the basic reproduction number R0 of 2019-nCoV to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval: 1.4-3.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission.<br/>
- In this study, we used the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) to assess the transmissibility of the 2019-nCoV.<br/>
- Sustained human transmission (i.e., basic reproduction number R 0 > 1) is supported by the confirmed human-to-human transmissibility.<br/>
- The basic reproduction number, R 0 , which is the number of persons infected by the transmission of a pathogen from one infected person during the infectious time, is given by<br/>

# Public health mitigation measures that could be effective for control
#### Highlights<br/>
- Substandard implementation of appropriate infection prevention and control measures could influence COVID-19 global spread.<br/>
- Therefore, applying preventive measures to control COVID-19 infection is the most critical intervention.<br/>
- In the absence of vaccines and specific treatment, the only available public health tools to control persontoperson transmittable diseases are isolation and quarantine, social distancing, and community containment measures.<br/>
- These results indicated that quarantine measures (or with vaccination that is not yet available) are the most effective containment strategy to control the epidemic.<br/>
