*The Lancet - Mar 04, 2020*<br/>
- 11, 12 Host factors associated with mortality in this outbreak were older age (>60 years), smoking history, pre-existing pneumonia, abnormal renal function, and comorbidity.<br/>
- DPP4 receptors are upregulated in the lungs of smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which might explain why patients with comorbid lung diseases are prone to severe illness.<br/>
- These factors include male sex, comorbid pre-existing illnesses (such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, cancer, chronic heart, lung, and kidney disease, and immunocompromised states), low serum albumin, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, concomitant infections, and positive plasma MERS-CoV RNA.<br/>
- MERS-CoV causes more severe disease in people older than 60 years, and those with chronic comorbid diseases such as renal disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, immunosuppression, and diabetes.<br/>

by Schwartz, David A.; Graham, Ashley L.<br/>
*Viruses - 2020*<br/>
- There were 3 deaths among the pregnant women with SARS (maternal mortality rate of 30%) and no deaths in the non-pregnant group of infected women (P = 0.006).<br/>
- Two women with SARS recovered and maintained their pregnancy but had infants with IUGR.<br/>
- reported the findings from 7 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV.<br/>
- Pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV, a related coronavirus, appear to have increased morbidity and mortality when compared to non-pregnant women, suggesting that MERS-CoV could also lead to severe clinical outcomes in pregnancy.<br/>
- Among the 5 women who presented after 24 weeks gestation, 4 had preterm deliveries (80%).<br/>
- During the 1957-1958 Asian flu epidemic, 10% of all deaths occurred in pregnant women, and their CFR was twice as high as that of infected women who were not pregnant.<br/>
- The clinical outcomes among pregnant women with SARS in Hong Kong were worse than those occurring in infected women who were not pregnant.<br/>
- In the placentas of 2 women who were convalescing from SARS-CoV infection in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy the placentas were highly abnormal.<br/>
- As a result of the immunological changes that occur during pregnancy, women who are pregnant are included in this high-risk group.<br/>
- In the case of 2 women who were convalescing from SARS-CoV infection during the 1st trimester of pregnancy, the placentas were found to be normal.<br/>

*The Lancet - Mar 13, 2020*<br/>
- On Feb 6, 2020, a neonate born to a pregnant woman with COVID-19 pneumonia tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection 36 h after birth.<br/>
- Urgent questions that need to be addressed promptly include whether pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia will develop distinct symptoms from non-pregnant adults, whether pregnant women who have confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia are more likely to die of the infection or to undergo preterm labour, and whether COVID-19 could spread vertically and pose risks to the fetus and neonate.<br/>
- The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those of non-pregnant adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.<br/>
- 14 Previous studies have already shown no evidence of perinatal SARS infection among infants born to mothers who developed SARS infection during pregnancy.<br/>
- Neonate 4 had a birthweight of 1880 g and the pregnancy was complicated by pre-eclampsia.<br/>
- Future investigations of these issues and follow-up studies of pregnant women with COVID-19 infection, as well as neonates, will be necessary to ascertain the safety and health of mothers and babies exposed to SARS-CoV-2.<br/>
- Based on data from this small group of patients, there is currently no evidence of vertical transmission in pregnant women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in the third trimester.<br/>
- Nonetheless, this single case of an infected neonate suggests that we should pay special attention to prevent infections in newborn babies born to mothers with COVID-19 pneumonia.<br/>

*Mar 17, 2020*<br/>
- A main objective of this paper is to quantify the effect of various social and economic factors in mediating the transmission rates of the virus, which may help identify potential behavioral and socioeconomic risk factors for infections.<br/>
- Impacts of social and economic factors on the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China<br/>
- We investigate the impacts of many social, economic and environmental variables in mediating the transmission rates (Eq.<br/>
- While many socioeconomic factors moderate the spread of the virus, the actual population flow from the source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions.<br/>
- First, our analysis is connected to the economics and epidemiologic literature on the influencing factors of and ways of preventing the spread of infectious diseases.<br/>

- In this study, we aimed to investigate psychological and behavioral responses to the threat of COVID-19 outbreak and to examine public perceptions associated with the response outcomes in mainland China.<br/>
- 14, 15 Behavioral changes are also associated with government involvement level, perceptions of diseases, and the stage of the outbreak, and these factors vary by diseases and settings.<br/>
- Perception factors associated with anxiety and behavioral responses Table 1 are controlled for.<br/>
- Our results suggested that perceived risk and severity of the disease as well as information reliability were important factors associated with the psychological and behavioral responses.<br/>
- These models adjusting for personal characteristics were then used to investigate associations between perception variables and primary outcomes.<br/>

- The findings provide guidance for future in-depth research on specific risk factors, as well as zoonotic disease control and prevention in southern China and potentially other regions with similar ecological and social contexts.<br/>
- 9,10 Further research to identify the risk factors among different populations will help develop more locally-relevant and fine-tuned risk mitigation strategies and address the social and ecological bias to identifying recommendations for other community settings.<br/>

- To estimate the effects of assumptions about asymptomatic transmission on the importance of asymptomatic transmission and estimates of the basic reproduction number R 0 , we parameterize the generation interval distributions of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases based on their means,Ḡ a andḠ s , and dispersions, κ a and κ s .<br/>
- Here we highlight the need to characterize the generation-interval distribution for asymptomatic transmission, and its consequences not only for contact tracing but for estimation of the basic reproduction number of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreakand of the effective proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential-growth phase.<br/>
- Figure 1B shows the effect of different assumptions about the generation interval of asymptomatic cases,Ḡ a , on the basic reproduction number R 0 .<br/>

*Mar 08, 2020*<br/>
- Under our fitted disease natural history parameters for serial interval scenario 1, with a shorter mean serial interval and hence substantial presymptomatic infectiousness, individual quarantine was considerably more effective than active monitoring at reducing onward transmission by an infected contact.<br/>
- However, the estimates for the serial interval of COVID-19, which impacts the amount of pre-symptomatic transmission, are varied.<br/>
- First, the serial interval and extent of presymptomatic transmission are important determinants of the effectiveness of interventions.<br/>

- 9 Firstly, R0 is not an intrinsic variable of the infectious agent, but it is calculated through at least three parameters: the duration of contagiousness; the likelihood of infection per contact between; and the contact rate, along with economical, social and environmental factors, that may vary among studies aimed to estimate the R0.<br/>
- Additionally, the basic reproductive number is constantly modified during an epidemic by the control measures adopted to reduce the fundamental coefficient of R0, namely: i) the duration of contagiousness; ii) the likelihood of infection per contact; and iii) the contact rate.<br/>
