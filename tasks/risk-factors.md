- 11, 12 Host factors associated with mortality in this outbreak were older age (>60 years), smoking history, pre-existing pneumonia, abnormal renal function, and comorbidity.<br/>
- DPP4 receptors are upregulated in the lungs of smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which might explain why patients with comorbid lung diseases are prone to severe illness.<br/>
- These factors include male sex, comorbid pre-existing illnesses (such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, cancer, chronic heart, lung, and kidney disease, and immunocompromised states), low serum albumin, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, concomitant infections, and positive plasma MERS-CoV RNA.<br/>
-        MERS-CoV causes more severe disease in people older than 60 years, and those with chronic comorbid diseases such as renal disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, immunosuppression, and diabetes.<br/>

- Two women with SARS recovered and maintained their pregnancy but had infants with IUGR.<br/>
- Pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV, a related coronavirus, appear to have increased morbidity and mortality when compared to non-pregnant women, suggesting that MERS-CoV could also lead to severe clinical outcomes in pregnancy.<br/>
- Among the 5 women who presented after 24 weeks gestation, 4 had preterm deliveries (80%).<br/>
- During the 1957-1958 Asian flu epidemic, 10% of all deaths occurred in pregnant women, and their CFR was twice as high as that of infected women who were not pregnant .<br/>
- The clinical outcomes among pregnant women with SARS in Hong Kong were worse than those occurring in infected women who were not pregnant .<br/>
- In the placentas of 2 women who were convalescing from SARS-CoV infection in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy the placentas were highly abnormal.<br/>
- As a result of the immunological changes that occur during pregnancy, women who are pregnant are included in this high-risk group.<br/>
- In the case of 2 women who were convalescing from SARS-CoV infection during the 1st trimester of pregnancy, the placentas were found to be normal.<br/>
- Pregnant women may develop severe disease and fatal maternal and/or fetal outcomes as a result of MERS-CoV infection; however, little is known of the pathophysiology of this infection during pregnancy.<br/>

# Socio-economic and behavioral factors to understand the economic impact of the virus and whether there were differences.

#### Highlights<br/>
- A main objective of this paper is to quantify the effect of various social and economic factors in mediating the transmission rates of the virus, which may help identify potential behavioral and socioeconomic risk factors for infections.<br/>
- Impacts of social and economic factors on the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China<br/>
- COVID-19 pneumonia has had a significant impact on people's health and social activity behavior and on economic development.<br/>
- As per our recent recommendations (Asmundson & Taylor, 2020) , more research is needed to understand how individual difference factors, including health anxiety, specifically impact behaviour in response to COVID-19.<br/>
- Vulnerability Index (IDVI) that was introduced as a synthetic metric to account for a broader set of factors, including descriptors of health care, public health, economic, demographic, disease dynamics, and political (domestic and international) conditions .<br/>

*The Lancet - Mar 20, 2020*<br/>
- 13 If the response to disease outbreaks such as COVID-19 is to be effective and not reproduce or perpetuate gender and health inequities, it is important that gender norms, roles, and relations that influence women's and men's differential vulnerability to infection, exposure to pathogens, and treatment received, as well as how these may differ among different groups of women and men, are considered and addressed.<br/>
- 6 Consideration is further needed of the gendered implications of quarantine, such as whether women and men's different physical, cultural, security, and sanitary needs are recognised.<br/>

- Here we highlight the need to characterize the generation-interval distribution for asymptomatic transmission, and its consequences not only for contact tracing but for estimation of the basic reproduction number of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak and of the effective proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential-growth phase.<br/>

# Public health mitigation measures that could be effective for control
#### Highlights<br/>
- In the absence of effective treatments and vaccines, an early adoption of stringent public health measures is crucial in mitigating the scale and burden of an outbreak.<br/>
- It is thus essential to implement effective public health measures to curb this very outbreak without delay.<br/>
- This implies that public shutdown policies facilitate epidemic containment in a more effective way than quarantine measures.<br/>
- These results indicated that quarantine measures (or with vaccination that is not yet available) are the most effective containment strategy to control the epidemic.<br/>
- In the absence of vaccines and specific treatment, the only available public health tools to control persontoperson transmittable diseases are isolation and quarantine, social distancing, and community containment measures.<br/>

- The NHC announced that preventive and control measures of category A infectious diseases would be implemented to effectively fight SARS-CoV-2 and has also introduced public education campaigns.<br/>
- The NHC also formulated a community prevention and control program for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia to strengthen community-level epidemic prevention measures to control the spread of the outbreak .<br/>

- This further indicated that timely public health policies might significantly prevent the rapid spread of the epidemic.<br/>
- Moreover, this model could simulate the influence of different public health policies such as 1) lockdown of the city and 2) construction of temporary hospitals, which could help design the appropriate public health policies for epidemic control.<br/>

- In the absence of vaccines and specific treatment, the only available public health tools to control persontoperson transmittable diseases are isolation and quarantine, social distancing, and community containment measures.<br/>
-  Because of the extent of community spread, traditional public health measures might not be able to halt all human-to-human transmission, and we need to consider moving from containment to mitigation.<br/>
