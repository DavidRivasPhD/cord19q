According to previous studies on middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), smokers and COPD patients might be susceptible to MERS. Further, compared to non-smokers, smokers and COPD patients had a higher dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) expression, which was inversely correlated with lung function and diffusing capacity parameters 16 . Although the relationship between smoking history and susceptibility as well as worse outcomes in COVID-19 remains unclear, we cautioned that the prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with smoking history might be more severe.**<br/>

However, there are several limitations as detailed by the author. For example, the samples studied are derived from patients with lung cancer, which may not be fully reflective of the expression in normal lung tissues. Another potential limitation is that it is difficult to control for all confounders, as smoking may be related to other unhealthy life habits 16 and multiple comorbid diseases 17, 18 .**<br/>

There has been a considerable overlap in the comorbidities which has been widely accepted. For instance, diabetes [29] and COPD [30] frequently co-exist with hypertension or coronary heart diseases. Therefore, patients with co-existing comorbidities are more likely to have poorer baseline well-being. Importantly, we have verified the significantly escalated risk of poor prognosis in patients with two or more comorbidities as compared with those who had no or only a single comorbidity. Our findings implied that both the category and number of comorbidities should be taken into account when predicting the prognosis in patients with COVID-19.**<br/>

It probably occurred secondary to severe ARDS or large dose or long time of glucocorticoid therapy. The common pathogen included A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae, A flavus, C. glabrata, and C. albicans. However in our study, we found 5 co-infection virus cases other than the common bacterial and fungi, including influenza, rhino/enterovirus, respiratory syncytial viral and etc, suggesting that virus co-infection may be the common phenomena in winter pneumonia cases. Thus, positive pathogen results (especially virus and atypical pathogens, which is a type of common pathogens detection in unexplained pneumonia) cannot be the exclusive criteria to COVID-2019 during unexplained pneumonia diagnosis.**<br/>

Match (0.4879): **The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the most severe public health emergency since the outbreak of SARS in 2003. There are two main lines of combat against this public health threat: (1) control and prevention of the epidemic and (2) scientific research. For the effective control of the spread of a newly identified virus, we must first understand its infection and pathogenicity patterns, as quickly and as thoroughly as possible, to provide insights into the outbreak and develop targeted prevention and control strategies. [5] Genomic analyses indicate that 2019-nCoV may have originated from bats, [1, 2] and current knowledge of other coronaviruses that infect humans, e.g., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, suggests that there may have been intermediate animal hosts. [6] Regarding epidemiology, most of the initial patients were exposed to the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, but there were also individual cases that did not have a history of exposure. Tracing the source of the virus is of great importance for controlling the epidemic. The clinical manifestation of COVID-19 is very complex, and four clinical phenotypes have been identified, i.e. mildly, commonly, severely, and critically ill patients. [7] Some cases are characterized by mild symptoms and close-to-normal body temperatures and some are asymptomatic carriers, but both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients are contagious, which leads to difficulties in the timely identification of cases. Attention should be paid to the spectrum of disease severity and transmission modes to address questions such as how to identify the proportion of asymptomatic infections and whether a patient is contagious during the incubation period. Although a previous study showed that the overall mortality of the disease is about 2.3%, [8] but unregulated inflammatory responses and cytokine storms have been reported and the incidence of lymphopenia is also notable. [2] Insights into the pathological immune response are critical to understanding the pathogenesis of the disease and finding novel therapies to decrease mortality.**<br/>

[29] evaluated the obstetrical outcomes from a cohort of pregnant women who developed SARS in Hong Kong during the period of 1 February to 31 July 2003. Four of the 7 women (57%) that presented during the 1st trimester sustained spontaneous miscarriages, likely a result of the hypoxia that was caused by SARS-related acute respiratory distress. Among the 5 women who presented after 24 weeks gestation, 4 had preterm deliveries (80%).**<br/>

Two women with SARS recovered and maintained their pregnancy but had infants with IUGR. Among the live newborn infants, none had clinical or laboratory evidence for SARS-CoV infection. The new mothers who had developed SARS were advised not to breastfeed to prevent possible vertical transmission of the virus.**<br/>

It is likely, however, that the immunological changes that normally occur in pregnancy may alter susceptibility to the MERS-CoV and the severity of clinical illness [60] . Pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV, a related coronavirus, appear to have increased morbidity and mortality when compared to non-pregnant women, suggesting that MERS-CoV could also lead to severe clinical outcomes in pregnancy. To date, however, very few pregnancy-associated cases (n = 11) have been documented, with 91% having adverse clinical outcomes.**<br/>

Match (0.5199): **Containment measures in the COVID-19 outbreak have focused on identifying, treating, and isolating infected people, tracing and quarantining their close contacts, and promoting precautionary behaviors among the general public. Therefore, the psychological and behavioral responses of the general population play an important role in the control of the outbreak. Previous studies have explored on this topic in various culture settings with SARS, 4, 5, 6 pandemic influenza A(H1N1), 7, 8, 9, 10 and influenza A(H7N9). 11, 12, 13 Cultural differences are evident in public responses. 14, 15 Behavioral changes are also associated with government involvement level, perceptions of diseases, and the stage of the outbreak, and these factors vary by diseases and settings. 4, 5, 8, 16 The current COVID-19 outbreak provides a unique platform to study behavioral changes for two main reasons. First, government engagement in the control of the outbreak has been unprecedented, for example, locking down Wuhan and surrounding cities, building new hospitals to treat infected patients in Wuhan within two weeks, extending holidays and school closure, deploying thousands of medical staff to heavily affected areas, and running intense public messaging campaigns. Second, the public are faced with rather mixed information, partly because knowledge of the newly emerging disease is evolving with the course of the outbreak. For example, the national technical protocols for COVID-19 released by the National Health Commission have been updated five times within a month. Both features might result in different public responses towards the outbreak. In this study, we aimed to investigate psychological and behavioral responses to the threat of COVID-19 outbreak and to examine public perceptions associated with the response outcomes in mainland China.**<br/>

A thorough understanding of the genetic characteristics of a virus is crucial to understand the way it is (or may be) transmitted (e.g. human-to-human transmissibility) in order to be able to anticipate the potential reach of an outbreak and develop effective countermeasures. The recent outbreak of a new type of coronavirus -2019-nCoV -provides plenty of examples of the way researchers seek to quickly approach the aforementioned problems of genetic decomposition of the virus [2, 8] and modelling of its transmission dynamics [15] .**<br/>

It quantifies the average number of secondary cases generated per case. If the reproduction number is below 1.0, infections occur in isolated clusters as self-limited chains of transmission, and persistence of the disease would require continued undetected importations. On the other hand, reproduction numbers above 1.0 indicate sustained community transmission (18, 26) . Using epidemiological data and mathematical modeling tools, we are monitoring the effective reproduction number, Rt, of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Singapore in real-time, and here we report the evolution of Rt by March 5, 2020. Specifically, we assess the effective reproduction number from the daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset after adjusting for reporting delays, and we also derive an estimate of the reproduction number based on the characteristics of the clusters of COVID-19 in Singapore.**<br/>

Also, the age of patients in the progression group was significantly higher than that in the improvement/stabilization group, and multivariate logistic analysis indicated that higher age was a risk factor for disease progression. Elderly individuals are physically frail and are likely to have several comorbidities, which not only increases the risk of pneumonia [12] but also affects their prognosis [13] . the assessment of comorbidities is an essential component in determining the prognosis of several diseases, especially pneumonia. [14] Probably because of the small sample size, there was no significant difference in any comorbidity including hypertension, diabetes, COPD, cancer, and others between the two groups.

Compared with those mild patients, patients diagnosed as severe pneumonia had numerous differences in laboratory results (Table 4) , including higher neutrophil, lower lymphocytes count, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, as well as higher levels of CRP. MuLBSTA score is used to predict mortality in viral pneumonia, amongst the 9 severe pneumonia patients their MuLBSTA scores were significantly higher, indicating they had higher mortality risks.**<br/>

Match (0.4789): **Here we have developed a simple model for age-structured transmission of 2019-nCoV with two components: an age-structured contact matrix dependent on the behaviour of the host population and an age-dependent susceptibility profile dependent on physiological response to infection. By using a previously-estimated synthetic contact matrix and age-stratified data, we were able to estimate age-dependent susceptibility profiles based on the first 425 and the first 4,021 cases in China. We then combined these estimated profiles with estimates of age-stratified contacts in 151 other countries to give us transmission matrices for these countries from which we could estimate the scale of basic reproductive ratios in each country relative to China. We demonstrated that taking age-specific susceptibility into account results in substantially different predictions of transmission intensity by country relative to a model without age-specific susceptibility; countries with older populations are at substantially higher risk than countries with younger populations.**<br/>

A number of social distancing measures have already been implemented in Chinese cities in the past few weeks including school and workplace closures. It should now be an urgent priority to quantify the effects of these measures and specifically whether they can reduce the effective reproductive number below 1, because this will guide the response strategies in other locations. During the 1918/19 influenza pandemic, cities in the United States, which implemented the most aggressive and sustained community measures were the most successful ones in mitigating the impact of that pandemic [22] .**<br/>
