# Smoking, pre-existing pulmonary disease

#### Highlights<br/>
- Moreover, interstitial lung diseases, history of smoking, bronchiectasis or asthma were underreported [1,            . [Lupia et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgar.2020.02.021)<br/>
- 21 Risk factors of cardiac events after pneumonia include older age, pre-existing cardiovascular diseases, and greater severity of pneumonia at presentation. [Zhou et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3)<br/>
- These factors include male sex, comorbid pre-existing illnesses (such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, cancer, chronic heart, lung, and kidney disease, and immunocompromised states), low serum albumin, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, concomitant infections, and positive plasma MERS-CoV RNA. [Memish et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(19)33221-0)<br/>
- None of the patients had underlying diseases such as diabetes, chronic hypertension, or cardiovascular disease. [Chen et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30360-3)<br/>
- Active smoking is not associated with severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [Lippi et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2020.03.014)<br/>

# Co-infections (determine whether co-existing respiratory/viral infections make the virus more transmissible or virulent) and other co-morbidities

#### Highlights<br/>
- However in our study, we found 5 co-infection virus cases other than the common bacterial and fungi, including influenza, rhino/enterovirus, respiratory syncytial viral and etc, suggesting that virus co-infection may be the common phenomena in winter pneumonia cases. [Ai et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022673)<br/>
- The ages of severe patients are older, and the proportion of underlying diseases is higher, and co-infection also occurs in severe patients. [Liu et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023671)<br/>
- Infections of other respiratory pathogens were reported in 16 patients (47.06%). [Zhang et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034686)<br/>
- As discussed in the study, pregnant women are susceptible to respiratory pathogens and to development of severe pneumonia, which possibly makes them more susceptible to COVID19 infection than the general population, especially if they have chronic diseases or maternal complications. [Qiao et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30365-2)<br/>
- The virus was also highly associated with influenza and other pathogens. [Tang et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.01.014)<br/>

# Socio-economic and behavioral factors to understand the economic impact of the virus and whether there were differences.

#### Highlights<br/>
- A main objective of this paper is to quantify the effect of various social and economic factors in mediating the transmission rates of the virus, which may help identify potential behavioral and socioeconomic risk factors for infections. [Qiu et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035238)<br/>
- Secondly, the influence of some 296 important factors, such as socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, were not 297 considered. [Ai et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020339)<br/>
- The limitations of our study are the individual differences and psychological conditions of the sample, the influence of environmental and cultural factors on the individual, and the patient's attention during the hospital stay. [Liu et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctcp.2020.101132)<br/>
- Our results suggested that perceived risk and severity of the disease as well as information reliability were important factors associated with the psychological and behavioral responses. [Qian et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024448)<br/>
- Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.

# Transmission dynamics of the virus, including the basic reproductive number, incubation period, serial interval, modes of transmission and environmental factors

#### Highlights<br/>
- In this model, the basic reproduction number is R 0 = β/γ, the incubation period is α −1 and the infectious period is γ −1 . [Boldog et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020503)<br/>
- The timing of transmission to secondary cases were simulated according to the infectiousness profile using a lognormal and exponential distribution respectively, where the serial intervals were estimated as the sum of the onset to transmission interval and the incubation period. [He et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036707)<br/>
- These traits include virulence, clinical severity, ease of human-to-human transmission, if the pathogen is transmissible during the disease incubation period (and if yes, then how long that incubation period is). [Peters et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.02.023)<br/>
- Additionally, the basic reproductive number is constantly modified during an epidemic by the control measures adopted to reduce the fundamental coefficient of R0, namely: i) the duration of contagiousness; ii) the likelihood of infection per contact; and iii) the contact rate. [Petrosillo et al](https://doi.org/10.4081/idr.2020.8516)<br/>
- Infections with 2019-nCoV can spread from person to person, and in the earliest phase of the outbreak the basic reproductive number was estimated to be around 2.2, assuming a mean serial interval of 7.5 days . [Cowling et al](https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.6.2000110)<br/>

# Severity of disease, including risk of fatality among symptomatic hospitalized patients, and high-risk patient groups

#### Highlights<br/>
- Similar to the 2002/2003 outbreak of SARS, severity of COVID-19 disease is associated with 25 increased age and/or a comorbidity, although severe disease is not limited to these risk groups . [Rockx et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.995639)<br/>
- As such, biomarkers are needed to identify severe disease among hospitalized patients. [Lippi et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.022)<br/>
- To aid clinical assessment, risk stratification, efficient resource allocation, and targeted public health interventions, future research must aim to further define those at high-risk of severe illness with COVID−19. [Jain et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.15.20035360)<br/>
- Older patients or those with underlying comorbidities are at higher risk of death. [Zhongliang Wang et al](https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa272)<br/>
- Compared with non-hospitalized patients, inpatients were older(≥8805;70years, 2.4% vs 33.3%, P<0.04). [Xu et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028084)<br/>

# Susceptibility of populations

#### Highlights<br/>
- All population have susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. [Yang et al](https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112150-20200227-00196)<br/>
- This pattern could point at age-related differences in susceptibility to infection, severe outcomes, or behavior. [Source](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019935)<br/>
- BackgroundDue to the general susceptibility of new coronaviruses, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of elderly and young patients may be different. [Liu et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.005)<br/>
- The transmission and mobility model does not account, at this stage, for heterogeneities due to age differences in susceptibility and contact patterns. [Chinazzi et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021261)<br/>
- Current clinical observation suggest that people's age and gender are two risk factors in the susceptibility to COVID-19 1 . [Zhao et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.20031096)<br/>

# Public health mitigation measures that could be effective for control
#### Highlights<br/>
- Meanwhile, timely and effective control measures were warranted to further reduce the spread of COVID-19. [Wang et al](https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200210-00086)<br/>
- Public health programmes coordinate rapid case finding, tracing of contacts of cases, and isolation measures to mitigate spread, and guide decision-making on broad public health measures, such as social distancing when required. [Peng et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2020.02.008)<br/>
- Therefore, based on the transmission route of SARS-CoV, current preventive measures, including maintaining good personal and environmental health, and implementing strict contact and droplet prevention measures in the community, can effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV 6 . [Cui et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028225)<br/>
- Infection control measures within the hospital setting and an aggressive public health response might also have prevented further exposures. [Ghinai et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30607-3)<br/>
- The age-specific 246 control and prevention interventions are needed. [Zhao et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031849)<br/>
