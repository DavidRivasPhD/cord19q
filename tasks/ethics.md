# Efforts to articulate and translate existing ethical principles and standards to salient issues in COVID-2019

#### Highlights<br/>
- Objective Conduct comprehensive analysis of the regulatory requirement of ethical review regarding to the response of public health emergency, illustrate particular ethical review and ethical administration strategies for COVID-19 Emergency Research. [ZHANG et al](None)<br/>
- Its principles and organisation derive from the British National Health Service model, and it is based on three fundamental principles. [Remuzzi et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30627-9)<br/>
- 9 Third, and most importantly, Article 3.1 strictly requires all additional health measures to be implemented "with full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons", 1 which in turn must reflect the international law principles of necessity, legitimacy, and proportionality that govern limitations to and derogations from rights and freedoms. [Habibi et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30373-1)<br/>
- In the face of a public health crisis at a globalised scale, ethical consideration is far from being purely intellectual-it is at the core of any effective measure. [Chung et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30358-5)<br/>
- Clear national and international guidelines are needed on how to achieve the right balance in the leadership provided by public health and research experts facing an outbreak of an EZV. [Wang et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30350-0)<br/>

- Although the proposed definition was relevant only for Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs) and Regulatory Authorities, it is the first step to promote the communication and the coordination among European pharmaceutical stakeholders, regulators and professionals working in the different National Healthcare Systems for improving their resilience to shortages. [Musazzi et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171)<br/>
- 23 To enhance saturation, efforts were made to include a large variety of people with different backgrounds, to conduct a maximized number of interviews during the 8 wk study period in each province and to cover as many themes and subthemes from the interview guide as possible in each interview.

# Efforts to develop qualitative assessment frameworks to systematically collect information related to local barriers and enablers for the uptake and adherence to public health measures for prevention and control. This includes the rapid identification of the secondary impacts of these measures. (e.g. use of surgical masks, modification of health seeking behaviors for SRH, school closures)

#### Highlights<br/>
- Preventive measures for COVID-19, including case and contact tracing, quarantine and screening, as well as education to encourage good hand hygiene practices, should be in place. [Wang et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30561-4)<br/>
- Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05). [Wang et al](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17051729)<br/>
- 3 Strict social distancing measures were also implemented, including the compulsory wearing of face-masks in public. [Li et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033241)<br/>
- We also reviewed several detailed practical strategies to block virus transmission to provide a reference for preventing the transmission of 2019-nCov during dental diagnosis and treatment, including patient evaluation, hand hygiene, personal protective measures for the dental professionals, mouthrinse before dental procedures, rubber dam isolation, anti-retraction handpiece, disinfection of the clinic settings, and management of medical waste. [Peng et al](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41368-020-0075-9)<br/>
- Psychological factors are known to play a vital role in the success of public health strategies used to manage epidemics and pandemics; that is, risk communication, vaccination and antiviral therapy, hygiene practices, and social distancing.

# Efforts to identify how the burden of responding to the outbreak and implementing public health measures affects the physical and psychological health of those providing care for Covid-19 patients and identify the immediate needs that must be addressed.

#### Highlights<br/>
- The observations of mental health consequences and measures taken during the 2003 SARS outbreak could help inform health authorities and the public to provide mental health interventions to those who are in need. [Xiang et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30046-8)<br/>
-  timely mental health care needs to be developed urgently. [Carvalho et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112902)<br/>
- Accordingly, it is critical that public health decision-makers, health authorities, and health care providers across disciplines understand how health anxiety will influence responses to viral outbreaks, including current responses to COVID-19. [Asmundson et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102211)<br/>
- In addition, our findings are important in enabling government to allocate health resources and offer appropriate treatments for family members of HCWs who suffer mental health problems during COVID-19 epidemic and any of the infectious disease outbreak in the future. [Ying et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.20033290)<br/>
- These predictions can include estimates of expected morbidity burden that can help guide public health officials preparing the medical care and other resources needed to confront the epidemic. [Roosa et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.02.002)<br/>

# Efforts to identify the underlying drivers of fear, anxiety and stigma that fuel misinformation and rumor, particularly through social media.
#### Highlights<br/>
- In subsequent analysis, it was found that anxiety, fear, and anger were significantly positively related to problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping. [Huang et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031898)<br/>
- The infectious disease outbreaks commonly cause anxiety and fear, uncertainty, and stigmatization that can be prevented by medical and psychiatric treatment. [Park et al](https://doi.org/10.30773/pi.2020.0058)<br/>
- Participants rated the extent that they experienced anxious, fear, sadness and anger in response to the outbreak of COVID-19 in An Hui on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 (no such emotion) to 5 (the most intense feeling of the emotion). [Huang et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031898)<br/>
- That is why scores of the factors somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism were significantly higher than in the norm group. [sun et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.20030973)<br/>
- There are several ways in which high health anxiety may influence behavioural responses to the belief of being infected. [Asmundson et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102211)<br/>
