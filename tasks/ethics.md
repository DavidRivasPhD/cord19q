# Efforts to articulate and translate existing ethical principles and standards to salient issues in COVID-2019

#### Highlights<br/>
- We need to use our nursing skills to address global health equity.<br/>
- Its principles and organisation derive from the British National Health Service model, and it is based on three fundamental principles.<br/>
- How differentiation and combination of these interventions within a coherent and systematic package of public health measures contributes to different outbreak outcomes is an urgent global health issue that must be addressed in order to ensure that lessons from countries that have early experienced COVID-19 outbreak can be learnt by other countries in their preparedness and management of a likely pandemic.<br/>
- In the ongoing epidemic of COVID-19, all these aspects have not yet been fully addressed, although the global public health community is obliged to continually confront the epidemic and make political decisions encompassing travel restrictions, containment measures, and mitigation strategies.<br/>
- Our investigation has major practical implications for public health decision-and policy-makers.<br/>

[New regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in Europe](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171)<br/>

*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- Consequently, in the estimation of the shortage impact on the patient needs, this aspect should be primary for harmonizing the existing metrics and rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted.<br/>
- This manuscript aims to review the current upgrade of the European regulatory framework on medicine shortages and to propose a theoretical approach for 1) determining the shortage/unavailability impact on the capability of the National Healthcare Systems and 2) rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted in function of the leading cause of shortage (e.g., production, price and importation/exportation).<br/>
- Considering such critical issues and the latest position papers of stakeholder associations (Various Associations, 2019a,b), the establishment of harmonized metrics to classify the impact of medicine shortage on the National Healthcare Systems is a mandatory step to enhance the cooperation among competent National Authorities of the European countries and to rationalize the efforts to mitigate them.<br/>
- Here again, the establishing a unique decision tree to support National decision about medicine importation/exportation could be useful to reduce the fragmentation of shortage-mitigating strategies among European countries and to improve the effectiveness of the National strategic plan to satisfy the patients' needs, without altering the National regulatory framework.<br/>
- Noteworthy, it is not expectable that such provisions can solve the economic sustainability of a product in a long-term perspective, but there is no doubt that they can mitigate the MAH situations in short and medium-term, allowing the adoption of proper strategies to rationalize the production and to improve MAH sustainability.<br/>
- Indeed, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies adopted by professionals (e.g., pharmacists) and other stakeholders can be rationalized and harmonized based on the medicines shortage impact scores calculated by a competent National Authority.<br/>
- The European countries cannot face the different shortage crisis alone, but the cooperation at EU-level is necessary to provide practical and rational solutions to the problem.<br/>
- For mitigating shortages that affect the Union, the stronger coordination at EU-level and the harmonization of communication, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies are desirable and urgent.<br/>

*Social Science & Medicine - Apr 30, 2020*<br/>
- In contrast, this paper seeks to inform the ongoing movements promoting interdisciplinarity as key to addressing global health challenges.<br/>
- Global health governance is increasingly focused on epidemic and pandemic health emergencies that require an interdisciplinary approach to accessing scientific knowledge to guide preparedness and crisis response.<br/>
- Network theory provides a useful framework with which to explore the politics of knowledge in global health with its emphasis on individuals' social context.<br/>
- They share common principles and analytical and normative beliefs (causal beliefs).<br/>
- Social scientists were most successful in engaging when they framed their expertise in terms of already widely accepted concepts, such as the need for better communications with communities.<br/>

- 2 These frame Australia's Medical Research and Innovation Priorities, which include antimicrobial resistance, global health and health security, drug repurposing and translational research infrastructure, 15 capturing many of the key elements of this CTI Special Feature.<br/>
- In this Clinical & Translational Immunology Special Feature, I illustrate a strategic vision integrating these themes to create new, effective, economical and robust antiviral therapies and immunotherapies, with both the realities and the opportunities afforded to researchers working in our changing world squarely in mind.<br/>
- By expanding and cooperatively leveraging our respective research strengths, our efforts may yet solve the many pressing disease, cost and other sustainability issues of our time.<br/>
- Opening this CTI Special Feature, I outline ways these issues may be solved by creatively leveraging the so-called 'strengths' of viruses.<br/>

by Allam, Zaheer; Jones, David S.<br/>
*Healthcare - 2020*<br/>
- On the foremost, since these cut across different countries, which are part of the global community and have their unique laws and regulations concerning issues mentioned above, it is paramount to observe them as per the dictate of their source country's laws and regulations; hence, underlining the importance of working towards not only the promoting of data through its usage but also the need for standardized and universally agreed protocols.<br/>
- Here, as technological tools and laboratories around the world share data and collectively work to devise tools and cures, similar efforts should be considered between smart city professionals on how collaborative strategies could allow for the maximization of public safety on such and similar scenarios.<br/>
- This paper, inspired by the case of the COVID-19 virus, explores how urban resilience can be further achieved, and outlines the importance of seeking standardization of communication across and between smart cities.<br/>
- On this, it has been noted that the issue of data control and handling by a few corporations accords with their principles of nationalism, and that these work for their own wellbeing as well as to benefit the territories they are registered in.<br/>

# Efforts to embed ethics across all thematic areas, engage with novel ethical issues that arise and coordinate to minimize duplication of oversight

#### Highlights<br/>
- It will be necessary to coordinate a unified, global response across many differing geopolitical boundaries, political settings, cultures, and health system contexts.<br/>
- In the ongoing epidemic of COVID-19, all these aspects have not yet been fully addressed, although the global public health community is obliged to continually confront the epidemic and make political decisions encompassing travel restrictions, containment measures, and mitigation strategies.<br/>
- Although the proposed definition was relevant only for Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs) and Regulatory Authorities, it is the first step to promote the communication and the coordination among European pharmaceutical stakeholders, regulators and professionals working in the different National Healthcare Systems for improving their resilience to shortages.<br/>
- These goals have important public health implications and require coordinated national and international action on economic, environmental and social development.<br/>
- Single National points of contact (SPOC) have been created to facilitate sharing of the information about nationwide medicine shortages and the coordination of emergency plans among the competent National Authorities and the EMA.<br/>

*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- In particular, it has been highlighted the need to find collaborative solutions for medicine shortages to coordinate EU and National policies and communication campaigns.<br/>
- Although the proposed definition was relevant only for Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs) and Regulatory Authorities, it is the first step to promote the communication and the coordination among European pharmaceutical stakeholders, regulators and professionals working in the different National Healthcare Systems for improving their resilience to shortages.<br/>
- Considering such critical issues and the latest position papers of stakeholder associations (Various Associations, 2019a,b), the establishment of harmonized metrics to classify the impact of medicine shortage on the National Healthcare Systems is a mandatory step to enhance the cooperation among competent National Authorities of the European countries and to rationalize the efforts to mitigate them.<br/>
- In parallel, the cooperation among Regulatory Authorities and stakeholders of the pharmaceutical distribution chain should also be improved to set up shared strategies to mitigate distribution-related unavailability in specific geographic regions and to prevent shortages.<br/>
- Similarly, an ideal regulatory procedure should be composed by a "constant part", which should be recognized by all EU countries and stakeholders, and a "variable part", which should be more focused on the shortage cause to tackle or the peculiarities of the National regulatory framework.<br/>
- Indeed, a unique triage procedure for shortage impacts can improve the stakeholders' cooperation in managing the emergencies.<br/>
- For multi-country shortages, the EMA's scientific committees should also be involved to write harmonized recommendations to healthcare professionals.<br/>
- For mitigating shortages that affect the Union, the stronger coordination at EU-level and the harmonization of communication, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies are desirable and urgent.<br/>
- Single National points of contact (SPOC) have been created to facilitate sharing of the information about nationwide medicine shortages and the coordination of emergency plans among the competent National Authorities and the EMA.<br/>

- In contrast, this paper seeks to inform the ongoing movements promoting interdisciplinarity as key to addressing global health challenges.<br/>
- She separates the power of experts to control the production of knowledge and engage with key policy actors from policy objectives themselves.<br/>
- Global health governance is increasingly focused on epidemic and pandemic health emergencies that require an interdisciplinary approach to accessing scientific knowledge to guide preparedness and crisis response.<br/>
- Debates around issues, such as the level to which communities could reduce transmission rates themselves, did not prevent this group from providing a coherent response to the key policy dilemmas.<br/>
- This community did indeed emerge or coalesce around the demand placed on their expertise by policy makers concerned with the community engagement dimensions of the response.<br/>
- The second question seeks to locate the dynamics of this network in the literature on network theory and the role of epistemic communities in influencing policy during emergencies.<br/>
- Discussions took place on the funding and organisation of the anthropological response.<br/>
- Social scientists were most successful in engaging when they framed their expertise in terms of already widely accepted concepts, such as the need for better communications with communities.<br/>

# Efforts to establish a team at WHO that will be integrated within multidisciplinary research and operational platforms and that will connect with existing and expanded global networks of social sciences.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Organisations such as the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Global Research Collaboration For Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R) and the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) have been supported by the WHO Research Blueprint and its Global Coordinating Mechanism to provide a forum where those with the expertise and capacity to contribute to managing new threats can come together both between and during outbreaks to develop innovative solutions to emerging problems.<br/>
- Organisations such as the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and the Global Research Collaboration For Infectious Disease Preparedness, supported by the WHO Research Blueprint and its Global Coordinating Mechanism, were able to accelerate the outbreak response and rapidly initiate technical platforms for the development of vaccines and therapeutics.<br/>
- 4, 5 Crowdsourcing enables the collection of data from multiple platforms including health-care-oriented social networks, government and public health agencies, and global news sources.<br/>
- WHO's global COVID-19 strategic preparedness and response plan 13 therefore prioritises countries with weak health systems for technical and operational support from international partners.<br/>
- Despite the potential for genome sequencing to revolutionize outbreak response, the global public health community still struggles to coordinate data sharing across international borders, between academic researchers, and with private companies   .<br/>

*Social Science & Medicine - Apr 30, 2020*<br/>
- Global health governance is increasingly focused on epidemic and pandemic health emergencies that require an interdisciplinary approach to accessing scientific knowledge to guide preparedness and crisis response.<br/>
- Moira Faul's research on global education policy networks proposes that far from being "flat," networks can augment existing power relations and knowledge hierarchies (Faul, 2016) .<br/>
- By analysing data pertaining to researchers' and policy professionals' participation in policy networks one can test assumptions around interdisciplinarity and identify powerful knowledge gatekeepers.<br/>
- The emergent inter-epistemic community was only partially connected into the policy network and we should reject the description of the whole network as trans-disciplinary.<br/>
- There was also an evaluation of the Community Care Centres and additional funding from DFID supported village-level fieldwork by ERAP researchers from Njala University, leading to advice to social mobilisation teams.<br/>
- In contrast, this paper seeks to inform the ongoing movements promoting interdisciplinarity as key to addressing global health challenges.<br/>

- The platform could aggregate COVID-19 patient records across 126 connected hospitals and rapidly expand to enable open collaborations with key stakeholders such as government authorities, research institutions and laboratories.<br/>
- Therefore, a learning telemedicine system platform for coronavirus care was developed across connected hospitals, serving as the overarching authoritative source for diagnostic decision making and knowledge sharing for treatment.<br/>
- As telemedicine has inevitably altered the traditional working relationships within the healthcare network, how to ensure high-quality communication among healthcare practitioners poses a significant challenge.<br/>
- The telemedicine service platform layer enables a specialist treatment team of provincial specialists to conquer distance and provide access to clinicians working in the regional hospitals.<br/>

*Healthcare - 2020*<br/>
- The position of this paper is to advance that it now possible to integrate technologies like the use of smart devices through IoT networks and wearable devices, data from mobile apps and others to help users to share information with accredited and certified health professionals, and in this case, improve the outcomes for better cross disciplinary and more resilient protocols and policies.<br/>
- Here, as technological tools and laboratories around the world share data and collectively work to devise tools and cures, similar efforts should be considered between smart city professionals on how collaborative strategies could allow for the maximization of public safety on such and similar scenarios.<br/>
-  highlights that sensors installed in such locations have the potential to receive and distribute data in real-time to digital infrastructures within the network, and their interconnectedness in the network renders them extremely efficient in providing real-time updates on different issues.<br/>
- The fact that cities are increasingly tuning on the concept of Smart Cities and boasting an increased adoption rate of technological and connected products, existing surveillance networks can be re-calibrated to make use of those new sets of databases.<br/>

# Efforts to develop qualitative assessment frameworks to systematically collect information related to local barriers and enablers for the uptake and adherence to public health measures for prevention and control. This includes the rapid identification of the secondary impacts of these measures. (e.g. use of surgical masks, modification of health seeking behaviors for SRH, school closures)

#### Highlights<br/>
- Public health programmes coordinate rapid case finding, tracing of contacts of cases, and isolation measures to mitigate spread, and guide decision-making on broad public health measures, such as social distancing when required.<br/>
- Yet the quantitative performance of different policies matters for planning interventions and will influence how public health authorities prioritize different measures as the international and domestic context changes.<br/>
- First, close monitoring is needed of changes in epidemiology and of the effectiveness of public health strategies and their social acceptance.<br/>
- Effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources.<br/>
- No study has focused on the practical implications of public health interventions and measures.<br/>

[New regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in Europe](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171)<br/>
by Musazzi, Umberto M.; Di Giorgio, Domenico; Minghetti, Paola<br/>
*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- For mitigating shortages that affect the Union, the stronger coordination at EU-level and the harmonization of communication, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies are desirable and urgent.<br/>
- In this light, it should be flexible enough to rationalize the risk-assessment and risk-management strategies for the mitigation of the shortage effects in different industrial and healthcare settings.<br/>
- This manuscript aims to review the current upgrade of the European regulatory framework on medicine shortages and to propose a theoretical approach for 1) determining the shortage/unavailability impact on the capability of the National Healthcare Systems and 2) rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted in function of the leading cause of shortage (e.g., production, price and importation/exportation).<br/>
- Indeed, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies adopted by professionals (e.g., pharmacists) and other stakeholders can be rationalized and harmonized based on the medicines shortage impact scores calculated by a competent National Authority.<br/>
- Considering such critical issues and the latest position papers of stakeholder associations (Various Associations, 2019a,b), the establishment of harmonized metrics to classify the impact of medicine shortage on the National Healthcare Systems is a mandatory step to enhance the cooperation among competent National Authorities of the European countries and to rationalize the efforts to mitigate them.<br/>

- Decision-making and implementations may require adaptations and modifications to take into account setting-specific characteristics in terms of community features, local epidemiology and risk assessment, social habits, juridical provisions, organizational coordination, and availability of economic-financial resources.<br/>
- However, in the absence of effective medical interventions, these measures must be implemented and the success of these measures, despite their disruptive impact on social-economic activities, depends heavily on how these measures are adapted to the specific scenario, in terms not only of clinical and epidemiological variables but also of social aspects, including social habits, juridical provisions, and economic-financial resources.<br/>

# Efforts to identify the underlying drivers of fear, anxiety and stigma that fuel misinformation and rumor, particularly through social media.
#### Highlights<br/>
- 5 Conspiracy theories and misinformation are already circulating in traditional and social media about COVID-19.<br/>
- However, discrimination and prejudice driven by fear or misinformation have been flowing within and outside China [19,       , triggering panic and jeopardizing the response efforts of health workers and health authorities .<br/>
- In addition to sadness, anxiety, fear, and anger were also positively correlated with Problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping (ps <0.001).<br/>
- Journalists have an important role in health communication and should acknowl edge that their strong but inaccurate and misleading headlines agitate members of the public, cause fear, impinge on public communication, and diminish countermeasures for the outbreak.<br/>
- In subsequent analysis, it was found that anxiety, fear, and anger were significantly positively related to problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping.<br/>

- This is the time for solidarity, not stigma.<br/>
- A 24-h free hotline 7 d a week should be set up for public to respond to all the questions and concerns, relive the worries and panic, and clear the rumor or misinformation.<br/>
- Likewise, government authorities in every country should cooperate with China to oppose stigma, language abuse and discrimination caused by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and strictly abide by disciplines and laws stress that our enemy is SARS-CoV-2 rather than the fear and stigma.<br/>
- As the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Director of Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness Sylvie Briand said, "Fear and stigma go together and when people fear, they tend to stigmatize some groups and what we try to do is to reduce this fear" .<br/>
