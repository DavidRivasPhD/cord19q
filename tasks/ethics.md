# Efforts to articulate and translate existing ethical principles and standards to salient issues in COVID-2019

#### Highlights<br/>
- Combining these judgements with the estimates presented here can help public health officials to set rational and evidence-based 2019-nCoV control policies.<br/>
- In the ongoing epidemic of COVID-19, all these aspects have not yet been fully addressed, although the global public health community is obliged to continually confront the epidemic and make political decisions encompassing travel restrictions, containment measures, and mitigation strategies.<br/>
- How differentiation and combination of these interventions within a coherent and systematic package of public health measures contributes to different outbreak outcomes is an urgent global health issue that must be addressed in order to ensure that lessons from countries that have early experienced COVID-19 outbreak can be learnt by other countries in their preparedness and management of a likely pandemic.<br/>
- The assessment of virus novelty also has implications for virus naming and, on a different timescale, helps to define research priorities in virology and public health.<br/>
- The lessons learned from this crisis can provide insights to guide public health institutions as they implement telemedicine to increase resilience to future epidemic outbreaks.<br/>

[New regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in Europe](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171)<br/>
by Musazzi, Umberto M.; Di Giorgio, Domenico; Minghetti, Paola<br/>
*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- Consequently, in the estimation of the shortage impact on the patient needs, this aspect should be primary for harmonizing the existing metrics and rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted.<br/>
- This manuscript aims to review the current upgrade of the European regulatory framework on medicine shortages and to propose a theoretical approach for 1) determining the shortage/unavailability impact on the capability of the National Healthcare Systems and 2) rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted in function of the leading cause of shortage (e.g., production, price and importation/exportation).<br/>
- Considering such critical issues and the latest position papers of stakeholder associations (Various Associations, 2019a,b), the establishment of harmonized metrics to classify the impact of medicine shortage on the National Healthcare Systems is a mandatory step to enhance the cooperation among competent National Authorities of the European countries and to rationalize the efforts to mitigate them.<br/>
- Indeed, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies adopted by professionals (e.g., pharmacists) and other stakeholders can be rationalized and harmonized based on the medicines shortage impact scores calculated by a competent National Authority.<br/>
- Noteworthy, it is not expectable that such provisions can solve the economic sustainability of a product in a long-term perspective, but there is no doubt that they can mitigate the MAH situations in short and medium-term, allowing the adoption of proper strategies to rationalize the production and to improve MAH sustainability.<br/>
- Here again, the establishing a unique decision tree to support National decision about medicine importation/exportation could be useful to reduce the fragmentation of shortage-mitigating strategies among European countries and to improve the effectiveness of the National strategic plan to satisfy the patients' needs, without altering the National regulatory framework.<br/>
- In particular, it has been highlighted the need to find collaborative solutions for medicine shortages to coordinate EU and National policies and communication campaigns.<br/>

[A disconnected policy network: The UK's response to the Sierra Leone Ebola epidemic](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.112851)<br/>
by Georgalakis, James<br/>
*Social Science & Medicine - Apr 30, 2020*<br/>
- In contrast, this paper seeks to inform the ongoing movements promoting interdisciplinarity as key to addressing global health challenges.<br/>
- Social scientists were most successful in engaging when they framed their expertise in terms of already widely accepted concepts, such as the need for better communications with communities.<br/>
- Global health governance is increasingly focused on epidemic and pandemic health emergencies that require an interdisciplinary approach to accessing scientific knowledge to guide preparedness and crisis response.<br/>
- They share common principles and analytical and normative beliefs (causal beliefs).<br/>

[On the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak and the Smart City Network: Universal Data Sharing Standards Coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Benefit Urban Health Monitoring and Management](https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare8010046)<br/>
by Allam, Zaheer; Jones, David S.<br/>
*Healthcare - 2020*<br/>
- Here, as technological tools and laboratories around the world share data and collectively work to devise tools and cures, similar efforts should be considered between smart city professionals on how collaborative strategies could allow for the maximization of public safety on such and similar scenarios.<br/>
- On the foremost, since these cut across different countries, which are part of the global community and have their unique laws and regulations concerning issues mentioned above, it is paramount to observe them as per the dictate of their source country's laws and regulations; hence, underlining the importance of working towards not only the promoting of data through its usage but also the need for standardized and universally agreed protocols.<br/>
- This paper, inspired by the case of the COVID-19 virus, explores how urban resilience can be further achieved, and outlines the importance of seeking standardization of communication across and between smart cities.<br/>
- On this, it has been noted that the issue of data control and handling by a few corporations accords with their principles of nationalism, and that these work for their own wellbeing as well as to benefit the territories they are registered in.<br/>

- 9 Third, and most importantly, Article 3.1 strictly requires all additional health measures to be implemented "with full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons", 1 which in turn must reflect the international law principles of necessity, legitimacy, and proportionality that govern limitations to and derogations from rights and freedoms.<br/>
- We-16 global health law scholars-came to this conclusion after applying the interpretive framework of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 3 and reaching a jurisprudential consensus on the legal meaning of IHR Article 43 (panel).<br/>

# Efforts to embed ethics across all thematic areas, engage with novel ethical issues that arise and coordinate to minimize duplication of oversight

#### Highlights<br/>
- It will be necessary to coordinate a unified, global response across many differing geopolitical boundaries, political settings, cultures, and health system contexts.<br/>
- In the ongoing epidemic of COVID-19, all these aspects have not yet been fully addressed, although the global public health community is obliged to continually confront the epidemic and make political decisions encompassing travel restrictions, containment measures, and mitigation strategies.<br/>
- Health approach represents an attempt to deal with such complex problems engaging J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f professionals from many disciplines such as human, veterinary, and environmental health, as well as social sciences .<br/>
- Global health governance is increasingly focused on epidemic and pandemic health emergencies that require an interdisciplinary approach to accessing scientific knowledge to guide preparedness and crisis response.<br/>
- Getting ahead of COVID-19 requires not only slowing its spread, adequate funding for the health response, supporting research to advance our knowledge of it, integrated actions to mitigate the health, economic, and social impacts of the epidemic, among others, but also control of narratives regarding its scientific and clinical attributes and pandemic containment efforts-an effort that I do not think can be successful if executed on inadequate budgets by sleepdeprived communicators.<br/>

*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- In particular, it has been highlighted the need to find collaborative solutions for medicine shortages to coordinate EU and National policies and communication campaigns.<br/>
- Indeed, a unique triage procedure for shortage impacts can improve the stakeholders' cooperation in managing the emergencies.<br/>
- Considering such critical issues and the latest position papers of stakeholder associations (Various Associations, 2019a,b), the establishment of harmonized metrics to classify the impact of medicine shortage on the National Healthcare Systems is a mandatory step to enhance the cooperation among competent National Authorities of the European countries and to rationalize the efforts to mitigate them.<br/>
- Although the proposed definition was relevant only for Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs) and Regulatory Authorities, it is the first step to promote the communication and the coordination among European pharmaceutical stakeholders, regulators and professionals working in the different National Healthcare Systems for improving their resilience to shortages.<br/>
- For mitigating shortages that affect the Union, the stronger coordination at EU-level and the harmonization of communication, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies are desirable and urgent.<br/>
- As a consequence, rational and practical shortage emergency plans should originate from stronger cooperation among European countries and based on the assessment of pros/cons balance at a supranational level.<br/>
- For multi-country shortages, the EMA's scientific committees should also be involved to write harmonized recommendations to healthcare professionals.<br/>

- In contrast, this paper seeks to inform the ongoing movements promoting interdisciplinarity as key to addressing global health challenges.<br/>
- She separates the power of experts to control the production of knowledge and engage with key policy actors from policy objectives themselves.<br/>
- Global health governance is increasingly focused on epidemic and pandemic health emergencies that require an interdisciplinary approach to accessing scientific knowledge to guide preparedness and crisis response.<br/>
- Debates around issues, such as the level to which communities could reduce transmission rates themselves, did not prevent this group from providing a coherent response to the key policy dilemmas.<br/>
- This community did indeed emerge or coalesce around the demand placed on their expertise by policy makers concerned with the community engagement dimensions of the response.<br/>
- Social scientists were most successful in engaging when they framed their expertise in terms of already widely accepted concepts, such as the need for better communications with communities.<br/>

by Georgalakis, James<br/>
*Social Science & Medicine - Apr 30, 2020*<br/>
- Global health governance is increasingly focused on epidemic and pandemic health emergencies that require an interdisciplinary approach to accessing scientific knowledge to guide preparedness and crisis response.<br/>
- The emergent inter-epistemic community was only partially connected into the policy network and we should reject the description of the whole network as trans-disciplinary.<br/>
- Moira Faul's research on global education policy networks proposes that far from being "flat," networks can augment existing power relations and knowledge hierarchies (Faul, 2016) .<br/>
- By analysing data pertaining to researchers' and policy professionals' participation in policy networks one can test assumptions around interdisciplinarity and identify powerful knowledge gatekeepers.<br/>
- They made the case for interdisciplinarity and the value of social science in emergency preparedness and response.<br/>
- There was also an evaluation of the Community Care Centres and additional funding from DFID supported village-level fieldwork by ERAP researchers from Njala University, leading to advice to social mobilisation teams.<br/>

- The platform could aggregate COVID-19 patient records across 126 connected hospitals and rapidly expand to enable open collaborations with key stakeholders such as government authorities, research institutions and laboratories.<br/>
- Therefore, a learning telemedicine system platform for coronavirus care was developed across connected hospitals, serving as the overarching authoritative source for diagnostic decision making and knowledge sharing for treatment.<br/>
- The telemedicine service platform layer enables a specialist treatment team of provincial specialists to conquer distance and provide access to clinicians working in the regional hospitals.<br/>
- As telemedicine has inevitably altered the traditional working relationships within the healthcare network, how to ensure high-quality communication among healthcare practitioners poses a significant challenge.<br/>

- Big data and artificial intelligence systems are tools that can be used to fully integrate the information, conduct comprehensive research and analyze public health risks.<br/>

# Efforts to develop qualitative assessment frameworks to systematically collect information related to local barriers and enablers for the uptake and adherence to public health measures for prevention and control. This includes the rapid identification of the secondary impacts of these measures. (e.g. use of surgical masks, modification of health seeking behaviors for SRH, school closures)

#### Highlights<br/>
- Public health programmes coordinate rapid case finding, tracing of contacts of cases, and isolation measures to mitigate spread, and guide decision-making on broad public health measures, such as social distancing when required.<br/>
- 10 These interventions range from measures to encourage personal responsibility to identify disease, increase social distancing among community members including cancellation of public gatherings, and finally implement community quarantine.<br/>
- Psychological factors are known to play a vital role in the success of public health strategies used to manage epidemics and pandemics; that is, risk communication, vaccination and antiviral therapy, hygiene practices, and social distancing.<br/>
- Effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources.<br/>
- 3 Strict social distancing measures were also implemented, including the compulsory wearing of face-masks in public.<br/>

[New regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in Europe](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171)<br/>
by Musazzi, Umberto M.; Di Giorgio, Domenico; Minghetti, Paola<br/>
*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- For mitigating shortages that affect the Union, the stronger coordination at EU-level and the harmonization of communication, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies are desirable and urgent.<br/>
- In this way, the resulting metrics allow promoting, on the one hand, the harmonization of the risk assessment of the shortages at EU level and, on the other hand, the rationalization of the preventing management strategies in a cause-specific matter.<br/>
- Consequently, in the estimation of the shortage impact on the patient needs, this aspect should be primary for harmonizing the existing metrics and rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted.<br/>
- This manuscript aims to review the current upgrade of the European regulatory framework on medicine shortages and to propose a theoretical approach for 1) determining the shortage/unavailability impact on the capability of the National Healthcare Systems and 2) rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted in function of the leading cause of shortage (e.g., production, price and importation/exportation).<br/>
- In this light, it should be flexible enough to rationalize the risk-assessment and risk-management strategies for the mitigation of the shortage effects in different industrial and healthcare settings.<br/>
- Indeed, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies adopted by professionals (e.g., pharmacists) and other stakeholders can be rationalized and harmonized based on the medicines shortage impact scores calculated by a competent National Authority.<br/>

- Decision-making and implementations may require adaptations and modifications to take into account setting-specific characteristics in terms of community features, local epidemiology and risk assessment, social habits, juridical provisions, organizational coordination, and availability of economic-financial resources.<br/>
- However, in the absence of effective medical interventions, these measures must be implemented and the success of these measures, despite their disruptive impact on social-economic activities, depends heavily on how these measures are adapted to the specific scenario, in terms not only of clinical and epidemiological variables but also of social aspects, including social habits, juridical provisions, and economic-financial resources.<br/>
