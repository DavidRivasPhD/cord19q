[New regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in Europe](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171)<br/>
by Musazzi, Umberto M.; Di Giorgio, Domenico; Minghetti, Paola<br/>
*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- Although the proposed definition was relevant only for Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs) and Regulatory Authorities, it is the first step to promote the communication and the coordination among European pharmaceutical stakeholders, regulators and professionals working in the different National Healthcare Systems for improving their resilience to shortages.<br/>
- For these products, more centralized coordination of the risk control strategies by the EMA and, consequently, a more efficient sharing of information among National Regulatory Authorities are needed to better mitigation of shortage impact at a national level and to fulfil the needs of all the patients.<br/>
- In particular, it has been highlighted the need to find collaborative solutions for medicine shortages to coordinate EU and National policies and communication campaigns.<br/>
- Single National points of contact (SPOC) have been created to facilitate sharing of the information about nationwide medicine shortages and the coordination of emergency plans among the competent National Authorities and the EMA.<br/>
- Considering such critical issues and the latest position papers of stakeholder associations (Various Associations, 2019a,b), the establishment of harmonized metrics to classify the impact of medicine shortage on the National Healthcare Systems is a mandatory step to enhance the cooperation among competent National Authorities of the European countries and to rationalize the efforts to mitigate them.<br/>
- The second HMA/EMA guideline, "Good practice guidance for communication to the public on medicines' availability issues", aimed to enhance and align the European communication on a shortage to improve the awareness of healthcare professionals and patients and the cooperation among European stakeholders (EMA and HMA, 2019b).<br/>
- Indeed, a unique triage procedure for shortage impacts can improve the stakeholders' cooperation in managing the emergencies.<br/>
- Indeed, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies adopted by professionals (e.g., pharmacists) and other stakeholders can be rationalized and harmonized based on the medicines shortage impact scores calculated by a competent National Authority.<br/>

*The Lancet - Mar 11, 2020*<br/>
- Getting ahead of COVID-19 requires not only slowing its spread, adequate funding for the health response, supporting research to advance our knowledge of it, integrated actions to mitigate the health, economic, and social impacts of the epidemic, among others, but also control of narratives regarding its scientific and clinical attributes and pandemic containment efforts-an effort that I do not think can be successful if executed on inadequate budgets by sleepdeprived communicators.<br/>
- If governments, agencies, and health organisations want people at risk of infection to respond to COVID-19 with an appropriate level of alert, to cooperate with health authorities, and to act with compassion and humanity, I believe that they must be willing to fund their messengers on an unprecedented scale, with genuine urgency.<br/>

*The Lancet - Mar 13, 2020*<br/>
- As part of these social distancing policies, the Chinese Government encouraged people to stay at home; discouraged mass gatherings; cancelled or postponed large public events; and closed schools, universities, government offices, libraries, museums, and factories.<br/>
- First, countries facing potential spread of COVID19, or a similar outbreak in the future, should consider outbreak control "holidays" or closure periods-ie, periods of recommended or mandatory closure of nonessential workplaces and public insti tutions-as a firstline social distancing measure to slow the rate of transmission.<br/>
- As such, governments should use the closure period for information and education campaigns, community screening, active contact tracing, and isolation and quarantine to maximise impact.<br/>

*Mar 12, 2020*<br/>
- This analyses is a first insight into the effectiveness of travel restrictions for COVID-19 outbreak, supports the effectiveness of the Australian response, informs gradual lifting of the bans or placing of new bans on other countries, and could inform other countries in reducing the burden of importations and resulting domestic transmission of COVID-19.<br/>
- While it has been showed that distancing measures are highly effective (2, 22) a systematic review looking at the effectiveness of travel restrictions (23) , shows that international travel restriction are effective in delaying the epidemic but may not contain it.<br/>
- Travel bans and social distancing measures are effective public health tools to control epidemic diseases (2), and Australia successfully delayed the introduction of the 1918 pandemic by 1 year and reduced the total mortality compared to other countries (3) .<br/>

- While population age structure is crucial for understanding the populations at the highest risk of mortality both across and within countries, it is also vital for understanding how much social distancing measures are required in each population to reduce the number of most critical cases and overload on the health system-aka "flattening the curve"(13).<br/>
- The population structure of contact can be represented as age-homogeneous communities that have low contact between groups.<br/>

- And, multiple linear regression was used to test the association of ACE2 expression with multiple factors (age, gender, race, smoking status and data platform).<br/>
- Adjusted by other factors (age, gender, race and platforms) in multivariate analysis, smoking still shows a significant disparity in ACE2 gene expression (p-value=0.01, Fig.<br/>
- B shows the result from multivariate analysis with all factors including age, gender, race, smoking and platforms.<br/>
- Simple linear regressions were used to test the association of ACE2 gene expression with each single variable of age, gender, race and smoking status.<br/>
- In this study, we investigated the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression by analyzing bulk and single-cell transcriptome data.<br/>
- Here, we analyzed four large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression.<br/>

*Mar 16, 2020*<br/>
- Table 4 shows that the relationship between the severity of COVID-19 and individual life satisfaction depends on individuals' existing health and exercise status.<br/>
- Because the measures of the dependent variables of SF12, distress and life satisfaction used Likert scales, we tried to use predictors that were non-Likert scales, such as job status and severity of COVID-19 calculated based on archival data using the reported locations.<br/>
- There were also certain dimensions of SF12 that did not vary much by job status.<br/>
- Overall, the severity of COVID-19 in a prefecture did negatively predict people's life satisfaction in that prefecture, with this relationship depending on individuals' existing medical conditions and exercise levels.<br/>

*Mar 17, 2020*<br/>
- While many socioeconomic factors moderate the spread of the virus, the actual population flow from the source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions.<br/>
- Furthermore, we examine the moderator effects of socioeconomic factors on the transmission of COVID-19 in China, which include population flow out of Wuhan, the distance between cities, GDP per capita, number of doctors, and contemporaneous weather characteristics.<br/>

*Mar 08, 2020*<br/>
- In such circumstances where resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, 16 we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically with social distancing.<br/>
- In such settings, resources may be prioritized for broader social distancing measures, and active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically.<br/>
- In these circumstances, complementary interventions such as social distancing and pharmaceutical interventions may be needed if efficient contact tracing and rapid isolation are not readily achievable, regardless of the extent of presymptomatic transmission.<br/>
- In a setting where the COVID-19 case count continues to grow, resources may be prioritized for scalable community interventions such as social distancing; however, close contacts such as family members of a patient may still undergo targeted interventions.<br/>

*The Lancet - Mar 09, 2020*<br/>
- A degree of pragmatism will be needed for the implementation of social distancing and quarantine measures.<br/>
- However, it is easy to suggest a 60% reduction in transmission will do it or quarantining within 1 day from symptom onset will control transmission, but it is unclear what communication strategies or social distancing actions individuals and governments must put in place to achieve these desired outcomes.<br/>
- Such mitigation objectives are difficult to achieve by the same interventions, so choices must be made about priorities.<br/>
- We are uncertain about transmission in children, some communities are remote and unlikely to be exposed, voluntary social distancing by individuals and communities will have an impact, and mitigation efforts, such as the measures put in place in China, greatly reduce transmission.<br/>

*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- On the other side, if the shortage impact of medicinal products on the public health is low, it is not reasonable to charge the MAHs with additional costs and, therefore, affect the economic sustainability for the implementation of quality assurance systems that may have a limited positive impact on the continuity of care.<br/>
- 126a of Directive 2001/83/EC to ensure the availability of medicines in a specific market, particularly for those with a high shortage impact on public health.<br/>
- The seriousness of the shortage impact on public health is also influenced by the existence of therapeutic alternatives that can ensure the continuity of the care (PGEU, 2019) .<br/>
- For such products, manufacturer's resilience should be improved by more onerous provisions, such as the obligation for MAHs to qualify at least two suppliers of drug substance, the stockpiles' expansion and the implementation of the manufacturing technologies and risk assessment tools.<br/>
- It is not feasible to introduce economic incentives for all medicinal products since it can affect the budgets of the Regulatory Authorities or, more in general, those of the National Healthcare Systems.<br/>
- Regardless of the procedure required at the National level, the medicine importation is, in most of the cases, the unique possibility for healthcare professionals to ensure the continuity of care to patients if a National therapeutic alternative is not available.<br/>
- These strategies permit to improve MAH sustainability and to ensure a proper supply for the patient demand.<br/>
- Moreover, the promising results obtained by some National competent Authorities (e.g., AIFA) suggested that setting up cooperation schemes between administration and other stakeholders, fostering a responsible approach in managing crisis in medicines supply, also allowing, for instance, surveillance/verification programs that may represent rational and effective preventive strategies to monitor the activities of exporting wholesalers and distributors for reducing the risks of product unavailability.<br/>
- Indeed, especially for old medicinal products, the costs of the upgrade to the required high-quality standards and risk assessment plan may be too high to maintain the MAH economic sustainability.<br/>

- Ensuring that all countries have sustainable and widely accessible health resources is vital to achieving Universal Health Coverage: ie provision of health services for all when needed without suffering undue financial hardship.<br/>
- A key measurable goal for the success of health policy is assessing Universal Health Coverage, including access to effective and safe medicines and other health targets within the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.<br/>
- Trade and tariff barriers arising from evolving isolationist policies of the USA are also likely to restrict progress on implementation and the health impact of achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, not least through increased international costs of diagnostics, devices and medicines.<br/>
- There remains additional uncertainty following Brexit about arrangements for continuity of supplies of medicines, regulation of medicinal products and transnational access to new medicines across the region.<br/>
