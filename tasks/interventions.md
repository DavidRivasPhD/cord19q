# Guidance on ways to scale up NPIs in a more coordinated way (e.g., establish funding, infrastructure and authorities to support real time, authoritative (qualified participants) collaboration with all states to gain consensus on consistent guidance and to mobilize resources to geographic areas where critical shortfalls are identified) to give us time to enhance our health care delivery system capacity to respond to an increase in cases.

#### Highlights<br/>
- CDC mobilized early in the response and state and local health departments similarly increased capacity to provide clinical consultation regarding 2019-nCoV. [Bajema et al](https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6906e1)<br/>
- WHO's global COVID-19 strategic preparedness and response plan 13 therefore prioritises countries with weak health systems for technical and operational support from international partners. [Brennan et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30069-6)<br/>
- Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. [Remuzzi et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30627-9)<br/>
- 9 Strong health systems built on comprehensive primary care are able to integrate both functions, disseminating the emergency response resources and information required to community-level staff who have the breadth of training required to manage new suspected cases alongside routine family medicine. [Dunlop et al](https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgpopen20X101041)<br/>
- 1, 7, 8 The Chinese government responded immediately and mobilized the whole country's health resources to deal with this public health emergency. [Lu et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025510)<br/>

# Rapid assessment of the likely efficacy of school closures, travel bans, bans on mass gatherings of various sizes, and other social distancing approaches.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Extreme social distancing measures, including school closures, workplace closures, and avoiding any public gatherings all at once, can push the transmission to households leading to increased clustering in . [Source](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033050)<br/>
- To possibly succeed, substantial, even draconian measures that limit population mobility should be seriously and immediately considered in affected areas, as should strategies to drastically reduce within-population contact rates through cancellation of mass gatherings, school closures, and instituting work-from-home arrange ments, for example. [Wu et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30260-9)<br/>
- Extensive control measures were put into place, starting with massive decontamination efforts and, ultimately, closure of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, banning the trade of wildlife and poultry in wet markets, contact tracing of cases, exit screening at airports, lockdown and quarantine measures that progressed to include adjacent cities (an estimated 50e60 million people affected), school closures, extension of the Lunar New Year holiday, prohibition of mass gatherings, and building of two new hospitals (1000 and 1600 beds) to care for infected individuals. [Peng et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2020.02.008)<br/>
- Very strict control measures are enforced all over the country, such as tourism ban, school closure, meeting cancelation, etc. [Li et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023838)<br/>
- As drugs or vaccines are not yet available, various non-pharmaceutical measures have been recommended to reduce the spread of infection, including hygiene and disinfection, improving environmental control, early detection and reporting, isolation, quarantine, use of personal protective equipment , social distancing and travel restrictions .

# Methods to control the spread in communities, barriers to compliance and how these vary among different populations..

#### Highlights<br/>
- In an outbreak setting, different intervention strategies are aimed at reducing social mixing in different contexts in order to lower the overall transmission in the population. [Source](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033050)<br/>
- Different patterns of disease spread were observed in the two cities, driven by different patterns of population migration. [Ding et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024661)<br/>
- Additionally, the infection severity, including the infection-fatality rate across different ages and risk groups, must be established. [McBryde et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30161-4)<br/>
- There were significant differences in the percentage of positive samples found across different hospital areas (P < .01). [Ye et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.20034546)<br/>
- Among which, the parameters, ρ and θ E , are directly related to the nature of the disease, and hence are considered as constants in China, while, λ IN , q and γ IH may vary in different regions depending the local medical resources, population densities and containment measures.

- Characteristics of respondents, including gender, age, marital status, education, income, and All rights reserved. [Hou et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026146)<br/>
- An insufficiency of passenger data (eg, reason for travel [tourism vs business], nationality, age, sex, and socioeconomic status) also prevent us from accounting for different risk exposure of travellers to China. [Gilbert et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30411-6)<br/>
- Women were matched on sex, age, timing of contracting SARS, health care worker status, 173 underlying illness and whether the woman resided in a housing area where there was a large 174 outbreak. [Rasmussen et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.02.017)<br/>
- 5 Risk factors for severe disease outcomes are old age and comorbidities. [Wilder-Smith et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30129-8)<br/>
- Beyond age structure, there are large sex differences in mortality that need to be understood -with men at higher risk -some of which may be accounted for by the stark differences in smoking rates by sex in Asia. [Dowd et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036293)<br/>

# Research on why people fail to comply with public health advice, even if they want to do so (e.g., social or financial costs may be too high).

#### Highlights<br/>
- If doctors, especially non-infective or respiratory doctors, do not pay great attention to the patient when they are receiving patients, and take good care of them, they may easily cause their own infection. [CHEN et al](None)<br/>
- But to make confident predictions, they need to know much more about how easily the virus spreads, how sick it makes people, and whether infected people with no symptoms can still infect others. [Kupferschmidt et al](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.367.6478.610)<br/>
- The finding that those who exercised a lot (>2·5 hours per day) were less satisfied in more affected cities suggests we may need to pay attention to more physically active individuals, who might be more frustrated by the restrictions due to the outbreak. [Zhang et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.20034496)<br/>
- Moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to the spread of disease for a longer time and more people would be infected, and may even cause epidemic or outbreak again. [Wan et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029629)<br/>
- An additional factor is that people infected by SARS-CoV felt unwell and were likely to seek care in hospitals. [Peters et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.02.023)<br/>

This would include identifying policy and programmatic alternatives that lessen/mitigate risks to critical government services, food distribution and supplies, access to critical household supplies, and access to health diagnoses, treatment, and needed care, regardless of ability to pay.
#### Highlights<br/>
- These findings are important in enabling health authorities to allocate health resources and develop appropriate treatments for medical staff who have mental health problems. [Liu et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30077-8)<br/>
- The seriousness of the shortage impact on public health is also influenced by the existence of therapeutic alternatives that can ensure the continuity of the care (PGEU, 2019) . [Musazzi et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171)<br/>
- We argue that these data were heavily impacted by 87 availability of medical supplies and health care workers. [Lin et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.02.058)<br/>
- This will aid clinical assessment, risk stratification, and resource allocation, and allow public health interventions to be targeted at the most vulnerable. [Jain et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.15.20035360)<br/>
- If there are large-scale cases, the risk stratification and management will help alleviate the shortage of medical resources and reduce the mortality of critical patients. [Liu et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021584)<br/>
