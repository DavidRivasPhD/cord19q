# Guidance on ways to scale up NPIs in a more coordinated way (e.g., establish funding, infrastructure and authorities to support real time, authoritative (qualified participants) collaboration with all states to gain consensus on consistent guidance and to mobilize resources to geographic areas where critical shortfalls are identified) to give us time to enhance our health care delivery system capacity to respond to an increase in cases.

#### Highlights<br/>
- WHO's global COVID-19 strategic preparedness and response plan 13 therefore prioritises countries with weak health systems for technical and operational support from international partners.<br/>
- In addressing the research gaps identified here, there is a need for strong collaboration of a competent corps of epidemiological scientists and public health workers who have the flexibility to cope with the surge capacity required, as well as support from laboratories that can deliver on the ever rising demand for diagnostic tests for 2019-nCoV and related sequelae.<br/>
- These would be expected to include preparedness of equipment, staff and facilities based on learning from previous epidemics, clear public health information, relevant containment, surveillance, and reporting, and international cooperation among governments, health authorities, travel organisations and border control forces.<br/>
- As information and recommendations about COVID-19 continue to evolve, we want to emphasize our support of the CDC and other public health partners as the appropriate source of information and guidance for health care organizations and providers.<br/>
- 9 Strong health systems built on comprehensive primary care are able to integrate both functions, disseminating the emergency response resources and information required to community-level staff who have the breadth of training required to manage new suspected cases alongside routine family medicine.<br/>

[New regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in Europe](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171)<br/>
by Musazzi, Umberto M.; Di Giorgio, Domenico; Minghetti, Paola<br/>
*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- For these products, more centralized coordination of the risk control strategies by the EMA and, consequently, a more efficient sharing of information among National Regulatory Authorities are needed to better mitigation of shortage impact at a national level and to fulfil the needs of all the patients.<br/>
- Although the proposed definition was relevant only for Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs) and Regulatory Authorities, it is the first step to promote the communication and the coordination among European pharmaceutical stakeholders, regulators and professionals working in the different National Healthcare Systems for improving their resilience to shortages.<br/>
- Considering such critical issues and the latest position papers of stakeholder associations (Various Associations, 2019a,b), the establishment of harmonized metrics to classify the impact of medicine shortage on the National Healthcare Systems is a mandatory step to enhance the cooperation among competent National Authorities of the European countries and to rationalize the efforts to mitigate them.<br/>
- The second HMA/EMA guideline, "Good practice guidance for communication to the public on medicines' availability issues", aimed to enhance and align the European communication on a shortage to improve the awareness of healthcare professionals and patients and the cooperation among European stakeholders (EMA and HMA, 2019b).<br/>
- Indeed, a unique triage procedure for shortage impacts can improve the stakeholders' cooperation in managing the emergencies.<br/>
- Here again, the establishing a unique decision tree to support National decision about medicine importation/exportation could be useful to reduce the fragmentation of shortage-mitigating strategies among European countries and to improve the effectiveness of the National strategic plan to satisfy the patients' needs, without altering the National regulatory framework.<br/>
- In particular, it has been highlighted the need to find collaborative solutions for medicine shortages to coordinate EU and National policies and communication campaigns.<br/>
- Single National points of contact (SPOC) have been created to facilitate sharing of the information about nationwide medicine shortages and the coordination of emergency plans among the competent National Authorities and the EMA.<br/>

*The Lancet - Mar 11, 2020*<br/>
- Getting ahead of COVID-19 requires not only slowing its spread, adequate funding for the health response, supporting research to advance our knowledge of it, integrated actions to mitigate the health, economic, and social impacts of the epidemic, among others, but also control of narratives regarding its scientific and clinical attributes and pandemic containment efforts-an effort that I do not think can be successful if executed on inadequate budgets by sleepdeprived communicators.<br/>
- If governments, agencies, and health organisations want people at risk of infection to respond to COVID-19 with an appropriate level of alert, to cooperate with health authorities, and to act with compassion and humanity, I believe that they must be willing to fund their messengers on an unprecedented scale, with genuine urgency.<br/>

- Extreme social distancing measures, including school closures, workplace closures, and avoiding any public gatherings all at once, can push the transmission to households leading to increased clustering in .<br/>
- In the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, social distancing measures including but not limited to school and workplace closures and health promotions that encourage the general public to avoid crowded places are designed to drastically shift social mixing patterns and are often used in epidemic settings.<br/>
- 11 Models assessing the effectiveness of social distancing interventions, such as school closure, need to account for social structures and heterogeneities in mixing of individuals.<br/>

*The Lancet - Mar 09, 2020*<br/>
- Containment could be targeted to particular areas, schools, or mass gatherings.<br/>
- So what is left at present for mitigation is voluntary plus mandated quarantine, stopping mass gatherings, closure of educational institutes or places of work where infection has been identified, and isolation of households, towns, or cities.<br/>
- A degree of pragmatism will be needed for the implementation of social distancing and quarantine measures.<br/>

*The Lancet Infectious Diseases - Mar 05, 2020*<br/>
- The stringent control measures included school closures and closures of all universities and public places, as well as the cancellation of the public holiday in May.<br/>
- 10 These interventions range from measures to encourage personal responsibility to identify disease, increase social distancing among community members including cancellation of public gatherings, and finally implement community quarantine.<br/>
- Hence, China decided to enforce the most drastic of all classic public health measures: community containment with social distancing, community use of facemasks, and a lockdown of Wuhan's public transportation, including buses, trains, ferries, and airport.<br/>

*The Lancet - Mar 13, 2020*<br/>
- As part of these social distancing policies, the Chinese Government encouraged people to stay at home; discouraged mass gatherings; cancelled or postponed large public events; and closed schools, universities, government offices, libraries, museums, and factories.<br/>
- First, countries facing potential spread of COVID19, or a similar outbreak in the future, should consider outbreak control "holidays" or closure periods-ie, periods of recommended or mandatory closure of nonessential workplaces and public insti tutions-as a firstline social distancing measure to slow the rate of transmission.<br/>

- Governments may decide to promote social distancing policies through interventions such as school and workplace 160 closures or by issuing a ban on large gatherings.<br/>

# Methods to control the spread in communities, barriers to compliance and how these vary among different populations..

#### Highlights<br/>
- In an outbreak setting, different intervention strategies are aimed at reducing social mixing in different contexts in order to lower the overall transmission in the population.<br/>
- We are uncertain about transmission in children, some communities are remote and unlikely to be exposed, voluntary social distancing by individuals and communities will have an impact, and mitigation efforts, such as the measures put in place in China, greatly reduce transmission.<br/>
- Variation in climate, population density, demographics, social interactions, health care access and public health interventions can all affect transmission.<br/>
- While population age structure is crucial for understanding the populations at the highest risk of mortality both across and within countries, it is also vital for understanding how much social distancing measures are required in each population to reduce the number of most critical cases and overload on the health system-aka "flattening the curve" .<br/>
- 2 To reduce further spread of the disease, governments have implemented community measures to increase social distancing for those at highest risk of infection.<br/>

*Mar 16, 2020*<br/>
- The Chinese may differ to other populations in terms of their health-seeking behaviour, symptom reporting, prevalence of different comorbidities, as well as their access to high quality health services.<br/>
- Given the ubiquity of comorbidities in the elderly population, and their increased susceptibility to severe COVID-19 infection , knowledge on the differing prevalence and risk of various conditions may help to focus and tailor public health efforts such as the screening of asymptomatic individuals, risk communication, contact tracing, self-isolation and social distancing.<br/>

- Recognising the extent to which disease outbreaks affect women and men differently is a fundamental step to understanding the primary and secondary effects of a health emergency on different individuals and communities, and for creating effective, equitable policies and interventions.<br/>
- 13 If the response to disease outbreaks such as COVID-19 is to be effective and not reproduce or perpetuate gender and health inequities, it is important that gender norms, roles, and relations that influence women's and men's differential vulnerability to infection, exposure to pathogens, and treatment received, as well as how these may differ among different groups of women and men, are considered and addressed.<br/>

[The effect of control strategies that reduce social mixing on outcomes of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033050)<br/>
- In an outbreak setting, different intervention strategies are aimed at reducing social mixing in different contexts in order to lower the overall transmission in the population.<br/>
- 11 Models assessing the effectiveness of social distancing interventions, such as school closure, need to account for social structures and heterogeneities in mixing of individuals.<br/>

- For directly transmitted respiratory pathogens such as influenza, measles and coronaviruses, social mixing patterns shape the risk of individual-level infection and population-level transmission dynamics , as well as the effectiveness of control measures targeted at specific age groups .<br/>
- The measured age-specific social mixing matrices also varied considerably between different types and settings.<br/>

- While population age structure is crucial for understanding the populations at the highest risk of mortality both across and within countries, it is also vital for understanding how much social distancing measures are required in each population to reduce the number of most critical cases and overload on the health system-aka "flattening the curve" .<br/>
- The population structure of contact can be represented as age-homogeneous communities that have low contact between groups.<br/>

- While many socioeconomic factors moderate the spread of the virus, the actual population flow from the source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions.<br/>
- Furthermore, we examine the moderator effects of socioeconomic factors on the transmission of COVID-19 in China, which include population flow out of Wuhan, the distance between cities, GDP per capita, number of doctors, and contemporaneous weather characteristics.<br/>
- We investigate the impacts of many social, economic and environmental variables in mediating the transmission rates (Eq.<br/>

# Policy changes necessary to enable the compliance of individuals with limited resources and the underserved with NPIs.

#### Highlights<br/>
- In such settings, resources may be prioritized for broader social distancing measures, and active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically.<br/>
- Public health programmes coordinate rapid case finding, tracing of contacts of cases, and isolation measures to mitigate spread, and guide decision-making on broad public health measures, such as social distancing when required.<br/>
- Meanwhile, the supply of and demand for facemasks and other medical resources should be considered when planning for public health measures, so as to maintain the availability and affordability of medical resources.<br/>
- As COVID-19 spread has occurred in many regions globally, we believe our study provides an important tool to inform public health decisions regarding travel restriction and social distancing in these regions according to their public health capacity to maintain an effective contact tracing, quarantine and isolation procedure.<br/>
- Effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources.<br/>

- In such circumstances where resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, 16 we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically with social distancing.<br/>
- In such settings, resources may be prioritized for broader social distancing measures, and active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically.<br/>
- Interventions based on contact tracing, unlike mass interventions such as travel restrictions and social distancing, are targeted at individuals and therefore require resources --material and personnel --proportional to the number of cases traced: contact tracing requires detailed interview of case patients to learn of contacts and public health outreach to trace them; active monitoring of contacts may include twice-daily visits by healthcare workers or phone-based self-monitoring; 14 and individual quarantine of contacts requires private space, provision of essentials, and investment in enforcement.<br/>

- It is not feasible to introduce economic incentives for all medicinal products since it can affect the budgets of the Regulatory Authorities or, more in general, those of the National Healthcare Systems.<br/>
- For such products, manufacturer's resilience should be improved by more onerous provisions, such as the obligation for MAHs to qualify at least two suppliers of drug substance, the stockpiles' expansion and the implementation of the manufacturing technologies and risk assessment tools.<br/>
- These strategies permit to improve MAH sustainability and to ensure a proper supply for the patient demand.<br/>
- Here again, the establishing a unique decision tree to support National decision about medicine importation/exportation could be useful to reduce the fragmentation of shortage-mitigating strategies among European countries and to improve the effectiveness of the National strategic plan to satisfy the patients' needs, without altering the National regulatory framework.<br/>
- For products with a high shortage impact, the establishment of a shortage prevention plan seemed essential to ensure an appropriate and continued supply to fulfil patients' needs.<br/>
- Noteworthy, it is not expectable that such provisions can solve the economic sustainability of a product in a long-term perspective, but there is no doubt that they can mitigate the MAH situations in short and medium-term, allowing the adoption of proper strategies to rationalize the production and to improve MAH sustainability.<br/>

- Meanwhile, the supply of and demand for facemasks and other medical resources should be considered when planning for public health measures, so as to maintain the availability and affordability of medical resources.<br/>
- Effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources.<br/>
- This analysis could provide insight into the development of emergency plans regarding the adequacy and affordability of medical resources for future infectious disease outbreaks.<br/>

*Health Policy and Technology - Mar 31, 2020*<br/>
- Ensuring that all countries have sustainable and widely accessible health resources is vital to achieving Universal Health Coverage: ie provision of health services for all when needed without suffering undue financial hardship .<br/>
- A key measurable goal for the success of health policy is assessing Universal Health Coverage, including access to effective and safe medicines and other health targets within the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.<br/>
- Trade and tariff barriers arising from evolving isolationist policies of the USA are also likely to restrict progress on implementation and the health impact of achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, not least through increased international costs of diagnostics, devices and medicines.<br/>

- However, in the absence of effective medical interventions, these measures must be implemented and the success of these measures, despite their disruptive impact on social-economic activities, depends heavily on how these measures are adapted to the specific scenario, in terms not only of clinical and epidemiological variables but also of social aspects, including social habits, juridical provisions, and economic-financial resources.<br/>
- Decision-making and implementations may require adaptations and modifications to take into account setting-specific characteristics in terms of community features, local epidemiology and risk assessment, social habits, juridical provisions, organizational coordination, and availability of economic-financial resources.<br/>
