Match (0.6197): **Effective therapeutics and antivirals are urgently needed to decrease COVID-19 mortality. As specific therapies targeting 2019-nCoV are lacking, it may be useful to repurpose drugs already licensed for marketing or clinical trials to treat COVID-19 patients in an emergency response; researchers are actively working to identify such drugs. At the time of preparation of this manuscript, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the China-Japan Friendship Hospital had launched a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled clinical trial in Wuhan to test the effectiveness of remdesivir as an antiviral drug against 2019-nCoV, [12, 13] and studies have already shown that chloroquine phosphate is an effective treatment for COVID-19. [14] Clinical trials are also underway to validate the effectiveness of various other licensed drugs against COVID-19.**<br/>

Match (0.5842): **The first strategy is to test existing broad-spectrum anti-virals 18 . Interferons, ribavirin, and cyclophilin inhibitors used to treat coronavirus pneumonia fall into this category. The advantages of these therapies are that their metabolic characteristics, dosages used, potential efficacy and side effects are clear as they have been approved for treating viral infections. But the disadvantage is that these therapies are too "broad-spectrum" and cannot kill coronaviruses in a targeted manner, and their side effects should not be underestimated. The second strategy is to use existing molecular databases to screen for molecules that may have therapeutic effect on coronavirus 19, 20 . High-throughput screening makes this strategy possible, and new functions of many drug molecules can be found through this strategy, for example, the discovery of anti-HIV infection drug lopinavir/ritonavir. The third strategy is directly based on the genomic information and pathological characteristics of different coronaviruses to develop new targeted drugs from scratch.**<br/>

Match (0.6700): **Many interferons from the three classes have been tested for their antiviral activities against SARS-CoV both in vitro and in animal models. Interferon β has consistently been shown to be the most active, followed by interferon α. The use of corticosteroids with interferon alfacon-1 (synthetic interferon α) appeared to have improved oxygenation and faster resolution of chest radiograph abnormalities in observational studies with untreated controls. Interferon has been used in multiple observational studies to treat SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV patients [116, 117] . Interferons, with or without ribavirin, and lopinavir/ritonavir are most likely to be beneficial and are being trialed in China for 2019-nCoV. This drug treatment appears to be the most advanced. Timing of treatment is likely an important factor in effectiveness. A combination of ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir was used as a post-exposure prophylaxis in health care workers and may have reduced the risk of infection. Ribavirin alone is unlikely to have substantial antiviral activities at clinically used dosages. Hence, ribavirin with or without corticosteroids and with lopinavir and ritonavir are among the combinations employed. This was the most common agent reported in the available literature. Its efficacy has been assessed in observational studies, retrospective case series, retrospective cohort study, a prospective observational study, a prospective cohort study and randomized controlled trial ranging from seven to 229 participants [117] . Lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) was the earliest protease inhibitor combination introduced for the treatment of SARS-CoV. Its efficacy was documented in several studies, causing notably lower incidence of adverse outcomes than with ribavirin alone. Combined usage with ribavirin was also associated with lower incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, nosocomial infection and death, amongst other favorable outcomes. Recent in vitro studies have shown another HIV protease inhibitor, nelfinavir, to have antiviral capacity against SARS-CoV, although it has yet to show favorable outcomes in animal studies [118] . Remdesivir (Gilead Sciences, GS-5734) nucleoside analogue in vitro and in vivo data support GS-5734 development as a potential pan-coronavirus antiviral based on results against several coronaviruses (CoVs), including highly pathogenic CoVs and potentially emergent BatCoVs. The use of remdesivir may be a good candidate as an investigational treatment.**<br/>

Match (0.6671): **Other therapeutic agents have also been reported. A known antimalarial agent, chloroquine, elicits antiviral effects against multiple viruses including HIV type 1, hepatitis B and HCoV-229E. Chloroquine is also immunomodulatory, capable of suppressing the production and release of factors which mediate the inflammatory complications of viral diseases (tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 6) [121] . It is postulated that chloroquine works by altering ACE2 glycosylation and endosomal pH. Its anti-inflammatory properties may be beneficial for the treatment of SARS. Niclosamide as a known drug used in antihelminthic treatment. The efficacy of niclosamide as an inhibitor of virus replication was proven in several assays. In both immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence assays, niclosamide treatment was observed to completely inhibit viral antigen synthesis. Reduction of virus yield in infected cells was dose dependent. Niclosamide likely does not interfere in the early stages of virus attachment and entry into cells, nor does it function as a protease inhibitor. Mechanisms of niclosamide activity warrant further investigation [122] . Glycyrrhizin also reportedly inhibits virus adsorption and penetration in the early steps of virus replication. Glycyrrhizin was a significantly potent inhibitor with a low selectivity index when tested against several pathogenic flaviviruses. While preliminary results suggest production of nitrous oxide (which inhibits virus replication) through induction of nitrous oxide synthase, the mechanism of Glycyrrhizin against SARS-CoV remains unclear. The compound also has relatively lower toxicity compared to protease inhibitors like ribavirin [123] . Inhibitory activity was also detected in baicalin [124] , extracted from another herb used in the treatment of SARS in China and Hong Kong. Findings on these compounds are limited to in vitro studies [121] [122] [123] [124] .**<br/>

Match (0.6652): **Clinical trials are the most critical and time-consuming step of a drug candidates' journey to being approved ( Figure 2C ). However, safe-in-man BSAAs make this journey relatively short, because they have been already at phase 0, I and, sometime, at IIa of clinical trials as antibacterial, antiprotozoal, anticancer, etc. agent; i.e. they have been administered at sub-therapeutic doses to healthy volunteers to ensure the drugs are not harmful to the participants. Thus, safe-in-man BSAAs enter phase II and III, which assess the efficacy, effectiveness, safety and side effects of the drugs in clinic. It is important, however, to differentiate acute and chronic viral infections when repurposing BSAAs, given that drug concentrations and duration of the treatment could be different, and therefore, drug safety issues should be considered. **<br/>

SARS studies showed that binding and neutralizing antibodies are elicited in SARS-CoV infections, but their association with clinical outcomes is unclear [21] . Robust antibody responses were developed in severely infected SARS patients [22] . However, it is debated whether antibody-dependent enhancement played roles in disease exacerbation [23, 24] . Memory T cell responses are induced and maintained in SARS-CoV infected subjects [25] . T cell immunity was also confirmed to be necessary for resolving the viral infection in mouse models [26, 27] .**<br/>

Match (0.5598): **Most SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccines developed thus far are based on the inactivated or live attenuated viruses, DNAs, proteins, nanoparticles, viral vectors, including viruslike particles (VLPs) (Zeng et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2005; Du et al., 2009a Du et al., , 2016b Pimentel et al., 2009; Al-Amri et al., 2017) . Each vaccine type has different advantages and disadvantages. For instance, inactivated and liveattenuated virus-based vaccines are vaccine types developed using the most traditional approaches. Although they generally induce highly potent immune responses and/or protection, the possibility for incomplete inactivation of viruses or recovering virulence exists, resulting in significant safety concerns (Zhang et al., 2014) . Also, these traditional vaccines may induce the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection (Luo et al., 2018b) . Similarly, some viral-vectored vaccines can elicit specific antibody and cellular immune responses with neutralizing activity and protection, but they might also induce anti-vector immunity or present preexisting immunity, causing some harmful immune responses. Instead, DNA and nanoparticle vaccines maintain strong safety profile; however, the immunogenicity of these vaccines is usually lower than that of virus-or viral vector-based vaccines, often requiring optimization of sequences, components, or immunization routes, inclusion of appropriate adjuvants, or application of combinational immunization approaches (Zhang et al., 2014) .**<br/>

Match (0.5368): **Scant works have reported on the immunological features of 2019-nCoV, which could have significant bearing on the mechanistic studies of viral life cycle. Such analyses could also inform anti-viral immuno-therapeutic development, which can be either T cell-based or B cell-based. Antibodies can neutralize viral infectivity in a number of ways, such as interference with binding to receptors, block uptake into cells, etc. For SARS-CoV, the human ACE-2 protein is the functional receptor, and anti-ACE2 antibody can block viral replication (7) . On the other hand, previous studies have indicated a crucial role of both CD8 + and CD4 + T cells in SARS-CoV clearance (8, 9) , while Janice Oh et al also observed that development of SARS-CoV specific neutralizing antibodies requires CD4 + T helper cells (8) . In fact, there are examples of vaccines for influenza that contain both antibody and T cell inducing components (10, 11) .**<br/>

However, coronavirus is a single-stranded RNA virus prone to rapid mutations during transmission, nAbs without cross-reactivity to a broad spectrum of viral mutants could lead to treatment failure 10, [27] [28] [29] , therefore, highly potent and cross-protective nAbs and prophylactic vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are in urgent needs.**<br/>

Similar to DNA or VLP-based vaccines, subunit vaccines are generally safe without causing potential harmful immune responses, making them promising vaccine candidates. Moreover, subunit vaccines may target specific, well-defined neutralizing epitopes with improved immunogenicity and/or efficacy (Du et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2014) .**<br/>

The protein contained the first two domains of the CD4 receptor that are known to bind gp120 on the surface of infected HIV cells. CD4-IgG was shown to neutralize HIV in vitro, preventing infection. The protein was also safe when administered in patients, although only limited-to-mild clinical benefit was achieved 68,69 . Updated enhanced versions of CD4-IgG have been developed that additionally have a small peptide derived from the co-receptor, CCR5, enhancing affinity and giving even more potent neutralizing activity, essentially 100% of HIV isolates and making rhesus macaques resistant to multiple simian-human immunodeficiency virus challenges 70,71 . While HIV and 2019-nCoV are very different viruses, with different cell types, kinetics, and clinical courses, the previous results with HIV are encouraging that this could be a therapeutic strategy for 2019-nCoV. If anything, 2019-nCoV is likely more amenable to this neutralizing therapy given that the respiratory virus will only cause an acute infection, unlike HIV, which causes chronic infection in hosts with different cellular reservoirs.**<br/>

Match (0.7339): **The first strategy is to test existing broad-spectrum anti-virals 18 . Interferons, ribavirin, and cyclophilin inhibitors used to treat coronavirus pneumonia fall into this category. The advantages of these therapies are that their metabolic characteristics, dosages used, potential efficacy and side effects are clear as they have been approved for treating viral infections. But the disadvantage is that these therapies are too "broad-spectrum" and cannot kill coronaviruses in a targeted manner, and their side effects should not be underestimated. The second strategy is to use existing molecular databases to screen for molecules that may have therapeutic effect on coronavirus 19, 20 . High-throughput screening makes this strategy possible, and new functions of many drug molecules can be found through this strategy, for example, the discovery of anti-HIV infection drug lopinavir/ritonavir. The third strategy is directly based on the genomic information and pathological characteristics of different coronaviruses to develop new targeted drugs from scratch.**<br/>

Match (0.6749): **Opening this CTI Special Feature, I outline ways these issues may be solved by creatively leveraging the so-called 'strengths' of viruses. Viral RNA polymerisation and reverse transcription enable resistance to treatment by conferring extraordinary genetic diversity. However, these exact processes ultimately restrict viral infectivity by strongly limiting virus genome sizes and their incorporation of new information. I coin this evolutionary dilemma the 'information economy paradox'. Many viruses attempt to resolve this by manipulating multifunctional or multitasking host cell proteins (MMHPs), thereby maximising host subversion and viral infectivity at minimal informational cost. 4 I argue this exposes an 'Achilles Heel' that may be safely targeted via host-oriented therapies to impose devastating informational and fitness barriers on escape mutant selection. Furthermore, since MMHPs are often conserved targets within and between virus families, MMHP-targeting therapies may exhibit both robust and broadspectrum antiviral efficacy. Achieving this through drug repurposing will break the vicious cycle of escalating therapeutic development costs and trivial escape mutant selection, both quickly and in multiple places. I also discuss alternative posttranslational and RNA-based antiviral approaches, designer vaccines, immunotherapy and the emerging field of neo-virology. 4 I anticipate international efforts in these areas over the coming decade will enable the tapping of useful new biological functions and processes, methods for controlling infection, and the deployment of symbiotic or subclinical viruses in new therapies and biotechnologies that are so crucially needed.**<br/>

Therefore, it becomes paramount to ensure that the measures taken to contain a virus transcend nationalist agendas where data and information sharing is normally restricted, to a more global agenda where humanity and global order are encouraged. With such an approach, it would be easier to share urban health data across geographies to better monitor emerging health threats in order to provide more economic stability, thereby ensuring no disruptions on such sectors like tourism and travel industries, amongst others. This is possible by ensuring collaborative, proactive measures to control outbreak spread and thus, human movements. This would remove fears on travelers, and would have positive impacts upon the tourism industry, that has been seen to bear the economic brunt whenever such outbreaks occur. This can be achieved by ensuring that protocols on data sharing are calibrated to remove all hurdles pertaining to sharing of information. On this, Lawpoolsri et al.

Here, as technological tools and laboratories around the world share data and collectively work to devise tools and cures, similar efforts should be considered between smart city professionals on how collaborative strategies could allow for the maximization of public safety on such and similar scenarios. This is valid as smart cities host a rich array of technological products [6, 7] that can assist in early detection of outbreaks; either through thermal cameras or Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, and early discussions could render efforts towards better management of similar situations in case of future potential outbreaks, and to improve the health fabric of cities generally. While thermal cameras are not sufficient on their own for the detection of pandemics -like the case of the COVID-19, the integration of such products with artificial intelligence (AI) can provide added benefits. The fact that initial screenings of temperature is being pursued for the case of the COVID-19 at airports and in areas of mass convergence is a testament to its potential in an automated fashion. Kamel Boulos et al.

It is critical to rapidly design and develop effective vaccines to prevent infection of this new coronavirus. Since S protein and its fragments, such as RBD, of SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are prime targets for developing subunit vaccines against these two highly pathogenic human CoVs, it is expected that similar regions of 2019-nCoV can also be used as key targets for developing vaccines against this new coronavirus (Jiang et al., 2020) . Similarly, other regions of 2019-nCoV, including S1 and S2 subunits of S protein and N protein, can be applied as alternative targets for vaccine development. Taken together, the approaches and strategies in the development of subunit vaccines against SARS and MERS described in this review will provide important information for the rapid design and development of safe and effective subunit vaccines against 2019-nCoV infection.**<br/>

The potentiality of in silico methods can be exploited to find desired solutions with fewer trials and errors and thus saving both time and costs of the scientists. In this study, potential subunit vaccines were designed against the SARS-CoV-2 using various methods of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. To design the vaccines, the highly antigenic viral proteins as well as epitopes were used. Various computational studies of the suggested vaccine constructs revealed that these vaccines might confer good immunogenic response. For this reason, if satisfactory results are achieved in various in vivo and in vitro tests and trials, these suggested vaccine constructs might be used effectively for vaccination to prevent the coronavirus infection and spreading. Therefore, our present study should help the scientists to develop potential vaccines and therapeutics against the Wuhan Novel Coronavirus 2019.

Several vaccine platforms exist with the ability to induce protective responses: killed whole virus vaccines; split-virion vaccines; subunit vaccines; live-attenuated viral vaccines; viruslike particle vaccines; nanoparticle vaccines; and nucleic acid vaccines (DNA and RNA). In regard to choosing a vaccine target and platform, the vaccine candidate must be immunogenic and immune targeting must lead to virus neutralization or potent cytotoxic responses. To date, there is not a licenced vaccine for either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV although clinical trials have been initiated for MERS-CoV vaccines. Much of the focus for the development of a SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV vaccine has been on the S protein since it is immunogenic and antibodies targeting it can neutralize the virus [59, 60] . Our analysis of the S protein ( Figure 2 ) suggests that it has potential for vaccine development which can be related to work previously done for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.**<br/>

Match (0.5051): **Establishing an animal model of infection and disease pathogenesis is imperative for understanding several essential elements of viral disease in the infected host, including host tropism, immune responses, and modes of transmission, as well as for the progression of therapeutic development. Having an animal model that can recapitulate human disease is essential for vaccine and therapeutic development as well as testing. For a potential animal model to be susceptible to infection, the virus must be able to 1.) gain entry into host cells; 2.) overcome the host's antiviral responses; and 3.) disseminate virus following infection to allow infection of other neighbouring cells and tissues. It is also of importance for the model to be able to recapitulate human disease and viral transmission modes. When evaluating the ability of an animal to be infected by a virus and serve as a model, viral shedding, clinical disease, and seroconversion should be determined. The past animal models for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were not universal due to the expression of the virus-specific cellular receptors for entry [63] . As SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV do not share a cellular receptor, they do not share the same host range and susceptibility, which includes research animal models [64] . Cynomolgus macaques, ferrets, and cats were some of the first animals to be determined susceptible to SARS-CoV [65, 66] . The advantage of ferrets is that they are a smaller animal compared to non-human primates and also are able to recapitulate some of the clinical symptoms and transmission kinetics of human respiratory viruses including coughing, sneezing, fever, and weight loss [67] . Although mice can be infected with SARS-CoV, as shown by recovery of vRNA and the elicitation of neutralizing antibodies, infection does not cause severe disease [68] . However, SARS-CoV could be passaged in mice (15 times) for the establishment of a model with clinical features [69] . After the identification of MERS-CoV, it was quickly determined that typical research animal models were not susceptible to the virus including mice, Syrian hamsters, and ferrets. Larger non-human primate models, such as Rhesus macaques and common marmoset were determined susceptible. To make use of small animal models, transgenic mice have been engineered for MERS-CoV susceptibility through expression of the human DPP4 receptor [70] . Other attempts at other mouse model developments were not successful, including an immunocompromised 129/SATA1-/-1 mouse [63] . Having an understanding of the animal models and model development previously utilized for the other coronaviruses of interest will aid in the development of a model for 2019-nCoV. As is necessary, elucidation of the receptor will help guide in development, and creating a clinical picture of the acute symptoms in humans will be essential for vaccine and antiviral evaluation.**<br/>

The clinical characteristics and treatment of 2019-nCoV and SARS both suggested a serious problem of immunopathology, particularly in the lung mucosa, which is complex and unique. It might be due to the fact that a systematic protective immune response is not enough to protect against viral infection. Currently, one of the most dangerous but valuable experiments is to perform tests on immune cells in the blood and lungs of infected patients, preferably during different stages of viral infection. Data on clinical immunity can lay the foundation for future vaccine development. We need to be aware of the challenges and concerns that 2019-nCoV poses to our community. Every effort should be made to understand and control the disease. The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.

Match (0.4743): **The SARS-CoV-2 has caused one of the deadliest outbreaks in the recent times. Prevention of the newly emerging infection is very challenging as well as mandatory. The potentiality of in silico methods can be exploited to find desired solutions with fewer trials and errors and thus saving both time and costs of the scientists. In this study, potential subunit vaccines were designed against the SARS-CoV-2 using various methods of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. To design the vaccines, the highly antigenic viral proteins as well as epitopes were used. Various computational studies of the suggested vaccine constructs revealed that these vaccines might confer good immunogenic response. For this reason, if satisfactory results are achieved in various in vivo and in vitro tests and trials, these suggested vaccine constructs might be used effectively for vaccination to prevent the coronavirus infection and spreading. Therefore, our present study should help the scientists to develop potential vaccines and therapeutics against the Wuhan Novel Coronavirus 2019.

Here we have attempted to address some of these issues using foundations from previous coronavirus outbreaks as well as our own analysis. What is certain is that the numbers of reported cases are increasing and will continue to increase before the knowledge gaps surrounding 2019-nCoV are filled. Cooperation among public health officials, healthcare workers, and scientists will be key to gaining a foothold and containing virus spread. Acknowledgement of coronaviruses as a constant spillover threat is important for pandemic preparedness. Two key take-away messages are important at this time: 1) As noted by the previous lopsided cases of healthcare, healthcare workers and care givers should exercise extreme caution and use personal protective equipment (PPE) in providing care to 2019-nCoV infected patients; and 2) The research community should endeavour to compile diverse CoV reagents that can quickly be mobilized for rapid vaccine development, antiviral discovery, differential diagnosis, and specific diagnosis.**<br/>

Match (0.4776): **Compared with other vaccine types such as inactivated virus and viral-vectored vaccines, SARS and MERS subunit vaccines are much safer and do not cause obvious side effects. However, these subunit vaccines may face some important challenges, mostly arising from their relatively low immunogenicity, which must be combined with appropriate adjuvants or optimized for suitable protein sequences, fragment lengths, and immunization schedules. In addition, structure and epitope-based vaccine design has become a promising strategy to improve the efficacy of subunit vaccines. This is evidenced by a structurally designed MERS-CoV RBD-based protein which has significantly improved neutralizing activity and protection against MERS-CoV infection (Du et al., 2016a) . It is prospected that more structureguided novel strategies will be developed to improve the overall immunogenicity and efficacy of subunit vaccines against emerging pathogenic human coronaviruses, including those targeting SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Although a large number of SARS and MERS subunit vaccines have been developed with potent immunogenicity and/or protection in available animal models, virtually all remain in the preclinical stage. It is thus expected that one or several of these promising subunit vaccines can be further processed into clinical trials to confirm their immunogenicity against viral infections in humans.**<br/>

Match (0.4572): **Most SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccines developed thus far are based on the inactivated or live attenuated viruses, DNAs, proteins, nanoparticles, viral vectors, including viruslike particles (VLPs) (Zeng et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2005; Du et al., 2009a Du et al., , 2016b Pimentel et al., 2009; Al-Amri et al., 2017) . Each vaccine type has different advantages and disadvantages. For instance, inactivated and liveattenuated virus-based vaccines are vaccine types developed using the most traditional approaches. Although they generally induce highly potent immune responses and/or protection, the possibility for incomplete inactivation of viruses or recovering virulence exists, resulting in significant safety concerns (Zhang et al., 2014) . Also, these traditional vaccines may induce the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection (Luo et al., 2018b) . Similarly, some viral-vectored vaccines can elicit specific antibody and cellular immune responses with neutralizing activity and protection, but they might also induce anti-vector immunity or present preexisting immunity, causing some harmful immune responses. Instead, DNA and nanoparticle vaccines maintain strong safety profile; however, the immunogenicity of these vaccines is usually lower than that of virus-or viral vector-based vaccines, often requiring optimization of sequences, components, or immunization routes, inclusion of appropriate adjuvants, or application of combinational immunization approaches (Zhang et al., 2014) .**<br/>

Match (0.7117): **Great efforts are being made for the discovery of antiviral drugs, but there are no licensed therapeutic or vaccine for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection available in the market. Developing an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 is therefore a research priority. It is time-consuming and expensive to design novel vaccines against viruses by the use of kits and related antibodies [12] . Thus, we chose the method of immune-informatics, which is more efficient and more applicable for deep analysis of viral antigens, B-and T-cell linear epitope prediction, and evaluation of immunogenicity and virulence of pathogens.**<br/>

Match (0.6994): **There is an urgent need to develop rapid diagnostic tools and vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to treat this infection. Reliable, timely laboratory diagnosis and an effective vaccine are crucial for effective disease management and public health intervention. An effective vaccine should be affordable, and also the production platform should produce suitable vaccine candidates rapidly at low cost, especially during a disease outbreak. The advantages and disadvantages of the current expression systems for recombinant protein production are given in Table 1 . Currently, plant expression system offers many advantages over other conventional systems that have the potential to tackle the production of vaccine candidates rapidly at affordable cost facilitating the global vaccination programs, especially in resource-poor nations where the vaccines are needed most [15] .**<br/>

Match (0.6831): **Designing of a novel vaccine is very crucial to defending the rapid endless of global burden of disease [56] [57] [58] [59] . In the last few decades, biotechnology has advanced rapidly; alongside with the understanding of immunology which assisted the rise of new approaches towards rational vaccines design [60] . Peptide-based vaccines are designed to elicit immunity particular pathogens by selectively stimulating antigen specific for B and T cells [61] .Applying the advanced bioinformatics tools and databases, various peptide-based vaccines could be designed where the peptides act as ligands [62] [63] [64] . This approach has been used frequently in Saint Louis encephalitis virus [65] , dengue virus [66] , chikungunya virus [67] proposing promising peptides for designing vaccines.**<br/>

Match (0.6772): **The SARS-CoV-2 has caused one of the deadliest outbreaks in the recent times. Prevention of the newly emerging infection is very challenging as well as mandatory. The potentiality of in silico methods can be exploited to find desired solutions with fewer trials and errors and thus saving both time and costs of the scientists. In this study, potential subunit vaccines were designed against the SARS-CoV-2 using various methods of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. To design the vaccines, the highly antigenic viral proteins as well as epitopes were used. Various computational studies of the suggested vaccine constructs revealed that these vaccines might confer good immunogenic response. For this reason, if satisfactory results are achieved in various in vivo and in vitro tests and trials, these suggested vaccine constructs might be used effectively for vaccination to prevent the coronavirus infection and spreading. Therefore, our present study should help the scientists to develop potential vaccines and therapeutics against the Wuhan Novel Coronavirus 2019.

Match (0.6755): **It is critical to rapidly identify immune epitopes. The S protein is of crucial in the fuse and entry of virus into host cells [1] , therefore it is a primary target for neutralizing antibodies. The specificity of epitopebased vaccines can be enhanced by selecting parts of S protein exposed on the surface [28] . Medical biotechnology is important in developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. However, computer-based immune-informatics can improve time and economic effectiveness, as a result, it is also an essential method in immunogenic analysis and vaccine development.**<br/>

Match (0.6586): **Compared with other vaccine types such as inactivated virus and viral-vectored vaccines, SARS and MERS subunit vaccines are much safer and do not cause obvious side effects. However, these subunit vaccines may face some important challenges, mostly arising from their relatively low immunogenicity, which must be combined with appropriate adjuvants or optimized for suitable protein sequences, fragment lengths, and immunization schedules. In addition, structure and epitope-based vaccine design has become a promising strategy to improve the efficacy of subunit vaccines. This is evidenced by a structurally designed MERS-CoV RBD-based protein which has significantly improved neutralizing activity and protection against MERS-CoV infection (Du et al., 2016a) . It is prospected that more structureguided novel strategies will be developed to improve the overall immunogenicity and efficacy of subunit vaccines against emerging pathogenic human coronaviruses, including those targeting SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Although a large number of SARS and MERS subunit vaccines have been developed with potent immunogenicity and/or protection in available animal models, virtually all remain in the preclinical stage. It is thus expected that one or several of these promising subunit vaccines can be further processed into clinical trials to confirm their immunogenicity against viral infections in humans.**<br/>

Match (0.6552): **The dire situations facing patients in outbreak scenarios demand quick responses by the healthcare community and the biotech industry. Unfortunately, many of the traditional options that guide drug development are inadequate for outbreaks; a process that takes years can't help patients who are dying today, and economies that are being halted. In these situations, studies have often been conducted on compassionate use, and clinical trial approvals expedited. This was most recently seen in the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak, where a variety of clinical trial candidates were studied. Many of these therapies failed, but ultimately a vaccine did emerge that was fully protective against the virus 12 . It is important to note that, unlike the current situation with 2019-nCoV, Ebola had already been studied for years and this particular neutralizing vaccine made and tested in preclinical animal models years prior to the outbreak 13 . For 2019-nCoV, beyond knowing the sequence of spike (S) protein of the coronavirus (GenBank: MN908947.3), there are no studies on how immunogenic this particular protein will be beyond surrogate comparisons to SARS and MERS, which limits the potential ability to quickly produce a vaccine. Moreover, while a vaccine would be greatly effective in helping to stop the spread of 2019-nCoV, an effective therapy is also needed for the patients infected with 2019-nCoV today, similar to the situation of Ebola patients needing effective therapies while vaccines were being developed.**<br/>

Match (0.6525): **Currently, the newly identified 2019-nCoV is spreading to infect people, resulting in significant global concerns. It is critical to rapidly design and develop effective vaccines to prevent infection of this new coronavirus. Since S protein and its fragments, such as RBD, of SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are prime targets for developing subunit vaccines against these two highly pathogenic human CoVs, it is expected that similar regions of 2019-nCoV can also be used as key targets for developing vaccines against this new coronavirus (Jiang et al., 2020) . Similarly, other regions of 2019-nCoV, including S1 and S2 subunits of S protein and N protein, can be applied as alternative targets for vaccine development. Taken together, the approaches and strategies in the development of subunit vaccines against SARS and MERS described in this review will provide important information for the rapid design and development of safe and effective subunit vaccines against 2019-nCoV infection.**<br/>
