# Methods evaluating potential complication of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) in vaccine recipients.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Also, these traditional vaccines may induce the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection (Luo et al., 2018b) .<br/>
- It has been reported that the high levels of neutralizing antibodies have a protective 107 effect on SARS-CoV infection, but the low neutralizing antibody are more susceptible 108 to enhance the SARS-CoV infection and trigger antibody-dependent enhancement 109 (ADE) effect 6 .<br/>
- Second, there are limitations from the S protein itself, such as mutations in the neutralization antibody epitopes in S protein that can cause virus escape , or non-neutralization antibody epitopes in vaccines that may elicit antibody-mediated disease enhancement (ADE) .<br/>
- Most importantly, RBD-based vaccine could induce neutralizing antibody responses and protection against SARS-CoV infection in the immunized animals, while it did not elicit ADE or other harmful immune responses, unlike the virusinactivated vaccines or full-length S protein-based vaccines as discussed above.<br/>
- Although subunit vaccines based on the full-length S protein may elicit potent immune responses and/or protection, studies have found that antibodies induced by some of these vaccines mediate enhancement of viral infection in vitro, as in the case of SARS-CoV (Kam et al., 2007; Jaume et al., 2012) , raising safety concerns for the development of full-length S protein-based subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.<br/>

- It is noted that the wild-type MERS-CoV RBD proteins consisting of the identified critical neutralizing domain confer partial protection of hDPP4-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mice from MERS-CoV infection without causing immunological toxicity or eosinophilic immune enhancement (Tai et al., 2016; Nyon et al., 2018) ; nevertheless, a structurally designed mutant version of such RBD protein with a non-neutralizing epitope masked (T579N) preserves intact conformation and significantly improves overall neutralizing activity and protective efficacy, resulting in the full protection of hDPP4-Tg mice against high-dose MERS-CoV challenge (Du et al., 2016a) .<br/>
- Similarly, some viral-vectored vaccines can elicit specific antibody and cellular immune responses with neutralizing activity and protection, but they might also induce anti-vector immunity or present preexisting immunity, causing some harmful immune responses.<br/>
- Moreover, immunization with a recombinant MERS-CoV NTD protein (rNTD) can induce neutralizing antibodies and cellmediated responses, protecting Ad-hDPP4-transduced mice against MERS-CoV challenge (Jiaming et al., 2017) .<br/>

- Should ADE be proven to be a mechanism of pathogenesis, both treatment regimens and vaccine development will need to take this phenomenon into consideration to ensure it is mitigated and in the case of a vaccine, avoided altogether.<br/>
- Individuals suffering the most may have been primed by one or more prior coronavirus exposures, and due to antigenic epitope heterogeneity, are experiencing the effects of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE).<br/>
-  revealed that enhancement may be improved by increasing dilutions of antibodies, suggesting a temporal relationship between priming and enhancement.<br/>
- ADE modulates the immune response and can elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm, one or all of which have been documented in severe cases and deaths.<br/>

# Exploration of use of best animal models and their predictive value for a human vaccine.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Having an understanding of the animal models and model development previously utilized for the other coronaviruses of interest will aid in the development of a model for 2019-nCoV.<br/>
- As vaccine candidates are identified, the requirement of animal models for vaccine development and evaluation will be essential.<br/>

- A data-driven drug repositioning framework discovered a potential therapeutic agent targeting COVID-19<br/>
- Considering that the development of a new drug generally takes years, probably the best therapeutic shortcut is to apply the drug repositioning strategy (i.e., finding the new uses of old drugs) to identify the potential antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 of existing drugs that have been approved for clinical use or to enter clinical trials.<br/>
- Thus, CVL218 may have great potential to be repurposed as an effective therapeutic agent to combat SARS-CoV-2 and prevent future epidemic outbreak.<br/>
- Under the current circumstance of the absence of the specific vaccines and medicines against SARS-CoV-2, it is urgent to discover effective therapies especially drugs to treat the resulting COVID-19 disease and prevent the virus from further spreading.<br/>

by Musazzi, Umberto M.; Di Giorgio, Domenico; Minghetti, Paola<br/>
*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- Here again, the establishing a unique decision tree to support National decision about medicine importation/exportation could be useful to reduce the fragmentation of shortage-mitigating strategies among European countries and to improve the effectiveness of the National strategic plan to satisfy the patients' needs, without altering the National regulatory framework.<br/>
- Moreover, the promising results obtained by some National competent Authorities (e.g., AIFA) suggested that setting up cooperation schemes between administration and other stakeholders, fostering a responsible approach in managing crisis in medicines supply, also allowing, for instance, surveillance/verification programs that may represent rational and effective preventive strategies to monitor the activities of exporting wholesalers and distributors for reducing the risks of product unavailability.<br/>
- This manuscript aims to review the current upgrade of the European regulatory framework on medicine shortages and to propose a theoretical approach for 1) determining the shortage/unavailability impact on the capability of the National Healthcare Systems and 2) rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted in function of the leading cause of shortage (e.g., production, price and importation/exportation).<br/>
- Consequently, in the estimation of the shortage impact on the patient needs, this aspect should be primary for harmonizing the existing metrics and rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted.<br/>
- Noteworthy, it is not expectable that such provisions can solve the economic sustainability of a product in a long-term perspective, but there is no doubt that they can mitigate the MAH situations in short and medium-term, allowing the adoption of proper strategies to rationalize the production and to improve MAH sustainability.<br/>

*Frontiers in Microbiology - 2020*<br/>
- Taken together, the approaches and strategies in the development of subunit vaccines against SARS and MERS described in this review will provide important information for the rapid design and development of safe and effective subunit vaccines against 2019-nCoV infection.<br/>
- In addition, structure and epitope-based vaccine design has become a promising strategy to improve the efficacy of subunit vaccines.<br/>
- It is prospected that more structureguided novel strategies will be developed to improve the overall immunogenicity and efficacy of subunit vaccines against emerging pathogenic human coronaviruses, including those targeting SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.<br/>
- Since S protein and its fragments, such as RBD, of SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are prime targets for developing subunit vaccines against these two highly pathogenic human CoVs, it is expected that similar regions of 2019-nCoV can also be used as key targets for developing vaccines against this new coronavirus (Jiang et al., 2020) .<br/>
- The targets used for the development of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV subunit vaccines are also be discussed.<br/>
- Other proteins, such as M protein, can be used as potential targets of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV subunit vaccines.<br/>
- The above studies indicate that protein lengths to be chosen as MERS-CoV subunit vaccines and/or structure-based vaccine design can impact on the immunogenicity and/or protection of RBD-based subunit vaccines.<br/>

*Journal of Infection in Developing Countries - 2020*<br/>
- The envelope protein (E) is also an attractive vaccine target that has been proposed for leverage in the development of live-attenuated vaccines .<br/>
- Much of the focus for the development of a SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV vaccine has been on the S protein since it is immunogenic and antibodies targeting it can neutralize the virus .<br/>
- Given that vaccines have been generated for MERSand SARS-CoVs by mutating the E protein, an E-based vaccine may represent an alternate candidate for 2019-nCoV vaccines.<br/>
- In regard to choosing a vaccine target and platform, the vaccine candidate must be immunogenic and immune targeting must lead to virus neutralization or potent cytotoxic responses.<br/>

- This analysis may help to prioritize resources for better prevention of the infection in those susceptible subjects.<br/>
- Also, it is likely that vaccines may be developed in the near future; in the lack of resources, susceptible groups may be prioritized to receive vaccination to maximize cost-effectiveness.<br/>
- We emphasize that the drugs highlighted in this work are meant to prioritize suitable candidates to speed up discovery for treatments, and are not supposed to be applied to clinical practice or trials yet.<br/>
- The drugs we highlighted in this study may help researchers to prioritize repositioning candidates for further studies, given the huge cost in developing a brand-new drug and that detailed investigations on every existing mediation will be impractical.<br/>
- For example, identification of those at greater risk may help to guide the prioritization of resources to reduce infection risks in susceptible groups.<br/>

- Development of animal models that faithfully mimic SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is critical not only in providing a more refined understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms involved but also to serve as a screening model for potential chemotherapeutic agents and vaccines.<br/>
- Vaccine development can be a challenge.<br/>
- A strong public health surveillance system to guide the response to the outbreak is important in the face of a lack of effective therapeutics or vaccines.<br/>

*Revista Clínica Española (English Edition) - Mar 31, 2020*<br/>
- Currently, there are candidates for MERS-CoV vaccine and there is an initiation of 3 programs to develop vaccines against the 2019-nCoV.<br/>
- There are novel vaccine technologies that accelerate the production of vaccine products 9 The use ofplatform technology, a system that uses the same basic components as a backbone, can be adapted for use against different pathogens as needed by inserting new genetic or protein sequences.<br/>
