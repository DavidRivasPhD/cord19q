# Methods evaluating potential complication of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) in vaccine recipients.

[Subunit Vaccines Against Emerging Pathogenic Human Coronaviruses](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00298)<br/>
by Du, Ning Wang; Jian, Shang; Shibo, Jiang; Lanying<br/>
*Frontiers in Microbiology - 2020*<br/>
- Also, these traditional vaccines may induce the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection (Luo et al., 2018b) .<br/>
- Although subunit vaccines based on the full-length S protein may elicit potent immune responses and/or protection, studies have found that antibodies induced by some of these vaccines mediate enhancement of viral infection in vitro, as in the case of SARS-CoV (Kam et al., 2007; Jaume et al., 2012) , raising safety concerns for the development of full-length S protein-based subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.<br/>
- Similarly, some viral-vectored vaccines can elicit specific antibody and cellular immune responses with neutralizing activity and protection, but they might also induce anti-vector immunity or present preexisting immunity, causing some harmful immune responses.<br/>
- Nevertheless, this vaccine also resulted in Fcγ receptor II (FcγRII)-dependent and ACE2-independent ADE, particularly in human monocytic or lymphoblastic cell lines infected with pseudotyped SARS-CoV expressing viral S protein, or in Raji B cells (B-cell lymphoma line) infected with live SARS-CoV (Kam et al., 2007; Jaume et al., 2012) , raising significant concerns over the use of full-length S protein as a SARS vaccine target.<br/>
- It is noted that the wild-type MERS-CoV RBD proteins consisting of the identified critical neutralizing domain confer partial protection of hDPP4-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mice from MERS-CoV infection without causing immunological toxicity or eosinophilic immune enhancement (Tai et al., 2016; Nyon et al., 2018) ; nevertheless, a structurally designed mutant version of such RBD protein with a non-neutralizing epitope masked (T579N) preserves intact conformation and significantly improves overall neutralizing activity and protective efficacy, resulting in the full protection of hDPP4-Tg mice against high-dose MERS-CoV challenge (Du et al., 2016a) .<br/>
- Moreover, immunization with a recombinant MERS-CoV NTD protein (rNTD) can induce neutralizing antibodies and cellmediated responses, protecting Ad-hDPP4-transduced mice against MERS-CoV challenge (Jiaming et al., 2017) .<br/>
- Therefore, more studies are needed to elucidate the potential for the development of MERS-CoV full-length S-based subunit vaccines, including understanding their protective efficacy and identifying possible harmful immune responses.<br/>

[Is COVID-19 receiving ADE from other coronaviruses?](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2020.02.006)<br/>
by Tetro, Jason A.<br/>
*Microbes and Infection - Mar 31, 2020*<br/>
- One possible answer is antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to other coronaviruses.<br/>
- Should ADE be proven to be a mechanism of pathogenesis, both treatment regimens and vaccine development will need to take this phenomenon into consideration to ensure it is mitigated and in the case of a vaccine, avoided altogether.<br/>
- Individuals suffering the most may have been primed by one or more prior coronavirus exposures, and due to antigenic epitope heterogeneity, are experiencing the effects of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE).<br/>
- Is COVID-19 receiving ADE from other coronaviruses?<br/>
- revealed that enhancement may be improved by increasing dilutions of antibodies, suggesting a temporal relationship between priming and enhancement.<br/>
- ADE modulates the immune response and can elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm, one or all of which have been documented in severe cases and deaths.<br/>

*Microbes and Infection - Mar 31, 2020*<br/>
- Second, there are limitations from the S protein itself, such as mutations in the neutralization antibody epitopes in S protein that can cause virus escape, or non-neutralization antibody epitopes in vaccines that may elicit antibody-mediated disease enhancement (ADE).<br/>
- Most importantly, RBD-based vaccine could induce neutralizing antibody responses and protection against SARS-CoV infection in the immunized animals, while it did not elicit ADE or other harmful immune responses, unlike the virusinactivated vaccines or full-length S protein-based vaccines as discussed above.<br/>

[New regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in Europe](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171)<br/>
by Musazzi, Umberto M.; Di Giorgio, Domenico; Minghetti, Paola<br/>
*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- Moreover, the promising results obtained by some National competent Authorities (e.g., AIFA) suggested that setting up cooperation schemes between administration and other stakeholders, fostering a responsible approach in managing crisis in medicines supply, also allowing, for instance, surveillance/verification programs that may represent rational and effective preventive strategies to monitor the activities of exporting wholesalers and distributors for reducing the risks of product unavailability.<br/>
- Here again, the establishing a unique decision tree to support National decision about medicine importation/exportation could be useful to reduce the fragmentation of shortage-mitigating strategies among European countries and to improve the effectiveness of the National strategic plan to satisfy the patients' needs, without altering the National regulatory framework.<br/>
- Consequently, in the estimation of the shortage impact on the patient needs, this aspect should be primary for harmonizing the existing metrics and rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted.<br/>
- In parallel, the cooperation among Regulatory Authorities and stakeholders of the pharmaceutical distribution chain should also be improved to set up shared strategies to mitigate distribution-related unavailability in specific geographic regions and to prevent shortages.<br/>
- This manuscript aims to review the current upgrade of the European regulatory framework on medicine shortages and to propose a theoretical approach for 1) determining the shortage/unavailability impact on the capability of the National Healthcare Systems and 2) rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted in function of the leading cause of shortage (e.g., production, price and importation/exportation).<br/>
- Noteworthy, it is not expectable that such provisions can solve the economic sustainability of a product in a long-term perspective, but there is no doubt that they can mitigate the MAH situations in short and medium-term, allowing the adoption of proper strategies to rationalize the production and to improve MAH sustainability.<br/>
- However, effective pharmaceutical quality systems require close collaboration between the MAH and their suppliers of raw materials to promote a more rational definition of the critical quality attributes of the drug product and to improve the production resilience.<br/>

*Frontiers in Microbiology - 2020*<br/>
- Taken together, the approaches and strategies in the development of subunit vaccines against SARS and MERS described in this review will provide important information for the rapid design and development of safe and effective subunit vaccines against 2019-nCoV infection.<br/>
- In addition, structure and epitope-based vaccine design has become a promising strategy to improve the efficacy of subunit vaccines.<br/>
- It is prospected that more structureguided novel strategies will be developed to improve the overall immunogenicity and efficacy of subunit vaccines against emerging pathogenic human coronaviruses, including those targeting SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.<br/>
- Since S protein and its fragments, such as RBD, of SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are prime targets for developing subunit vaccines against these two highly pathogenic human CoVs, it is expected that similar regions of 2019-nCoV can also be used as key targets for developing vaccines against this new coronavirus (Jiang et al., 2020) .<br/>
- The targets used for the development of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV subunit vaccines are also be discussed.<br/>
- Thus, this fragment can be used as an alternative target for subunit vaccine development.<br/>
- As a result, the S protein is also a major target for the development of subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.<br/>
- Other proteins, such as M protein, can be used as potential targets of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV subunit vaccines.<br/>
- Numerous subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV have been developed since the outbreak of SARS, the majority of which use the S protein and/or its antigenic fragments, in particular, RBD, as the vaccine target (Table 1) .<br/>

- This analysis may help to prioritize resources for better prevention of the infection in those susceptible subjects.<br/>
- Also, it is likely that vaccines may be developed in the near future; in the lack of resources, susceptible groups may be prioritized to receive vaccination to maximize cost-effectiveness.<br/>
- We emphasize that the drugs highlighted in this work are meant to prioritize suitable candidates to speed up discovery for treatments, and are not supposed to be applied to clinical practice or trials yet.<br/>
- The drugs we highlighted in this study may help researchers to prioritize repositioning candidates for further studies, given the huge cost in developing a brand-new drug and that detailed investigations on every existing mediation will be impractical.<br/>
- For example, identification of those at greater risk may help to guide the prioritization of resources to reduce infection risks in susceptible groups.<br/>

- Instead, DNA and nanoparticle vaccines maintain strong safety profile; however, the immunogenicity of these vaccines is usually lower than that of virus-or viral vector-based vaccines, often requiring optimization of sequences, components, or immunization routes, inclusion of appropriate adjuvants, or application of combinational immunization approaches (Zhang et al., 2014) .<br/>
- Therefore, more studies are needed to elucidate the potential for the development of MERS-CoV full-length S-based subunit vaccines, including understanding their protective efficacy and identifying possible harmful immune responses.<br/>
- In addition, structure and epitope-based vaccine design has become a promising strategy to improve the efficacy of subunit vaccines.<br/>
- For instance, inactivated and liveattenuated virus-based vaccines are vaccine types developed using the most traditional approaches.<br/>
- In spite of their immunogenicity, it appears that these N-and M-based SARS subunit vaccines have not been investigated for their protective efficacy against SARS-CoV infection.<br/>
- Taken together, the approaches and strategies in the development of subunit vaccines against SARS and MERS described in this review will provide important information for the rapid design and development of safe and effective subunit vaccines against 2019-nCoV infection.<br/>
- Antigen dosage, immunization doses, and intervals may significantly affect the immunogenicity of MERS-CoV subunit vaccines.<br/>
