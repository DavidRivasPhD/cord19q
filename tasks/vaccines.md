- Finally, the effectiveness of some anti-HIV/AIDS drugs for treating 2019-nCoV is analyzed. [Nguyen et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.30.927889)<br/>
- The treatment that have so far been attempted showed that 75 patients were administrated existing antiviral drugs. [Rothan et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102433)<br/>
- Although both flu and anti-HIV drugs are used currently in China for treatment of COVID-19, and chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, has recently found to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against 79] ; nevertheless more studies are required to standardize these therapies. [Abdelmageed et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.934232)<br/>
- As effective drugs for SARS, hormones and interferons can also be used to treat COVID-19 . [Xu et al](https://doi.org/10.3390/v12020244)<br/>
- However, all network-predicted repurposable drugs and drug combinations must be validated in preclinical models and randomized clinical trials before being used in patients. [Zhou et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020263)<br/>

# Clinical and bench trials to investigate less common viral inhibitors against COVID-19 such as naproxen, clarithromycin, and minocyclinethat that may exert effects on viral replication.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Anti-retroviral drugs belonging to the class of protease inhibitors, including Lopinavir and Ritonavir, usually utilized for the treatment of HIV/AIDS patients, seem to exert anti-viral effects against coronaviruses. [Tang et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.02.001)<br/>
- Initially, interferons-α nebulization, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and anti-viral drugs were used to reduce the viral load , however, only remdesivir has shown promising impact against the virus . [Adnan Shereen et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jare.2020.03.005)<br/>
- In the absence of a specific antiviral drug, anecdotal use of drugs like lopinavir, ritonavir, interferon-1b, RNA polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, and chloroquine has been reported. [Gupta et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.002)<br/>
- During the stay in hospitalization, the patients received treatment with antibiotics (Levofloxacin, Meropenem, Moxifloxacin, Cephalosporin), interferon and antiviral drugs (Arbidol, Lopinavir/ritonavir, Dnrunavir). [Fan et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.20026971)<br/>
- To date, effective treatment is lacking; however, clinical trials investigating the efficacy of several agents, including remdesivir and chloroquine, are underway in China. [Lai et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.02.012)<br/>

# Methods evaluating potential complication of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) in vaccine recipients.

#### Highlights<br/>
- In addition to potent neutralizing antibody elicitation upon immunization, potential 315 antibody-dependent disease enhancement (ADE) is the major concern for an efficacious The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . [Li et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.994152)<br/>
- In regard to choosing a vaccine target and platform, the vaccine candidate must be immunogenic and immune targeting must lead to virus neutralization or potent cytotoxic responses. [Ralph et al](https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.12425)<br/>
- Most importantly, RBD-based vaccine could induce neutralizing antibody responses and protection against SARS-CoV infection in the immunized animals, while it did not elicit ADE or other harmful immune responses, unlike the virusinactivated vaccines or full-length S protein-based vaccines as discussed above. [Yu et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2020.01.003)<br/>
- This data will guide the future development of vaccine and potential T-cell immunotherapy for the severe viral respiratory infections. [Liao et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026690)<br/>
- CR3022 has the potential to be developed as a therapeutic candidate, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection . [Adnan Shereen et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jare.2020.03.005)<br/>

|2020|Du et al|[Subunit Vaccines Against Emerging Pathogenic Human Coronaviruses](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00298)|Although subunit vaccines based on the full-length S protein may elicit potent immune responses and/or protection, studies have found that antibodies induced by some of these vaccines mediate enhancement of viral infection in vitro, as in the case of SARS-CoV (Kam et al., 2007; Jaume et al., 2012) , raising safety concerns for the development of full-length S protein-based subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.<br/><br/>Similarly, some viral-vectored vaccines can elicit specific antibody and cellular immune responses with neutralizing activity and protection, but they might also induce anti-vector immunity or present preexisting immunity, causing some harmful immune responses.<br/><br/>It is noted that the wild-type MERS-CoV RBD proteins consisting of the identified critical neutralizing domain confer partial protection of hDPP4-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mice from MERS-CoV infection without causing immunological toxicity or eosinophilic immune enhancement (Tai et al., 2016; Nyon et al., 2018) ; nevertheless, a structurally designed mutant version of such RBD protein with a non-neutralizing epitope masked (T579N) preserves intact conformation and significantly improves overall neutralizing activity and protective efficacy, resulting in the full protection of hDPP4-Tg mice against high-dose MERS-CoV challenge (Du et al., 2016a) .<br/><br/>In addition, structure and epitope-based vaccine design has become a promising strategy to improve the efficacy of subunit vaccines.<br/><br/>Therefore, more studies are needed to elucidate the potential for the development of MERS-CoV full-length S-based subunit vaccines, including understanding their protective efficacy and identifying possible harmful immune responses.|

# Exploration of use of best animal models and their predictive value for a human vaccine.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection. [Chen et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30211-7)<br/>
- The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were identified with the use of statistical approach. [Nesteruk et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.12.20021931)<br/>
- This model underperforms on viruses infecting hosts related to humans, but achieves higher accuracy than the "Chordata"-trained models and the best recall overall. [Bartoszewicz et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.29.925354)<br/>
- Development of animal models that faithfully mimic SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is critical not only in providing a more refined understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms involved but also to serve as a screening model for potential chemotherapeutic agents and vaccines. [Yang et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102434)<br/>
- In 10 provinces, both testing and mobility improve the models prediction and in only one province testing is the most important factor improving model prediction (Fig. [Source](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.20026708)<br/>

# Capabilities to discover a therapeutic (not vaccine) for the disease, and clinical effectiveness studies to discover therapeutics, to include antiviral agents.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Further research on COVID-19 pathogenesis could identify appropriate therapeutic targets to develop specific anti-virals against this newly emerging pathogen. [Shanmugaraj et al](https://doi.org/10.12932/ap-200220-0773)<br/>
- Currently, there is no effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19, therefore research efforts are focused on the rapid development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. [Rut et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.07.981928)<br/>
- Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy, which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases where no specific drugs or vaccines are available. [Jin et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.964882)<br/>
- Ironically, even after a decade of research on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics. [Shanmugaraj et al](https://doi.org/10.12932/ap-200220-0773)<br/>
- A data-driven drug repositioning framework discovered a potential therapeutic agent targeting COVID-19 [Ge et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.986836)<br/>

# Efforts targeted at a universal coronavirus vaccine.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Various vaccine strategies against coronavirus, such as using inactivated viruses, live-attenuated viruses, viral vectorbased vaccines, subunit vaccines, and recombinant proteins are under evaluation. [Amodio et al](https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare8010051)<br/>
- In addition, there is yet no universal influenza vaccine available against all influenza virus subtypes and hence seasonal influenza vaccines have to be updated annually and that vaccines for pandemic preparedness are a challenge      . [El Zowalaty et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2020.100124)<br/>
- The identification of a novel "cryptic" epitope for betacoronaviruses including SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 highlight a novel viral vulnerability that can be harnessed in combination with ACE2 receptor site targeting monoclonal antibodies for vaccine and therapeutic countermeasure development. [Joyce et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.15.992883)<br/>
- As a result, the S protein is also a major target for the development of subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. [Du et al](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00298)<br/>
- Therefore, an effective vaccine against SARS-COV-2 is needed to be design. [Tahir ul Qamar et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.28.970343)<br/>

# Efforts to develop animal models and standardize challenge studies

#### Highlights<br/>
- These studies are in progress, but it requires months to years to develop the vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. [Li et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2020.03.001)<br/>
- The development of neutralizing antibodies is underway, and efforts are also being made to develop a vaccine. [Wang et al](https://doi.org/10.1097/CM9.0000000000000777)<br/>
- Although researchers are racing against time to develop vaccines and test anti-viral drugs in clinical trials , there is no effective prophylactic and clinical treatment for COVID-19 yet. [Liao et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026690)<br/>
- Development of drugs is also hampered by various evaluation methods and animal models used for testing drug activity among different labs worldwide, which could postpone selection of the best drug for clinical trials. [Yu et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2020.01.003)<br/>
- While this strategy is a proof-of-concept and will require further testing using replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 viruses and validation in animal models before clinical tests in humans, it represents a unique approach to implement a rapid and broad antiviral defense in humans against emerging pathogens for which there are no effective vaccines.

# Approaches to evaluate risk for enhanced disease after vaccination

#### Highlights<br/>
- In addition, structure and epitope-based vaccine design has become a promising strategy to improve the efficacy of subunit vaccines. [Du et al](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00298)<br/>
- However, computer-based immune-informatics can improve time and economic effectiveness, as a result, it is also an essential method in immunogenic analysis and vaccine development. [Li et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.965434)<br/>
- Currently, there is no vaccine or therapeutic antibody to prevent the infection, and more time is required to develop an effective immune strategy against the pathogen. [Li et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.28.922922)<br/>
- Various computational studies of the suggested vaccine constructs revealed that these vaccines might confer good immunogenic response. [Sarkar et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.05.935072)<br/>
- This predictive view may help in designing an immune intervention or preventive vaccine for COVID-19 in the near future. [Prompetchara et al](https://doi.org/10.12932/ap-200220-0772)<br/>
