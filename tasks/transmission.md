# Range of incubation periods for the disease in humans (and how this varies across age and health status) and how long individuals are contagious, even after recovery.

#### Highlights<br/>
- The incubation period is generally 3-7 days (within 14 days) .<br/>
- We assume ν = 1/7, which means that the average period of infectiousness of asymptomatic infectious individuals is 7 days.<br/>
- We assume here that the latent period equals the incubation period, or the mean period of time between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms.<br/>
- After an incubation period of 5.6 days , 49% of infected people develop symptoms and become infectious while the remaining remain asymptomatic and do not transmit the disease further.<br/>
- The incubation period of 2019-nCoV is generally 3-7 days but no longer than 14 days, and the virus is infective during the incubation period.<br/>

- Depending on how much time has passed since exposure to the primary infected individual, those infected may not yet be symptomatic -this period of time between infection and symptoms is an important epidemiological trait of an infectious disease called the incubation period.<br/>
- When , for .2 R 0 = 2 example, remains below one unless the onset of infectiousness precedes symptoms by R IQ more than two days while has little tolerance for presymptomatic infectiousness (Figure 4) .<br/>
- Upon infection, individuals progress through a latent period before onset of infectiousness; during the duration of infectiousness, the relative infectiousness follows a triangular distribution.<br/>

- From (I 2 ), the length of which differs according to the underlying virus, where we assume that the progression of the illness is not severe, individuals recover.<br/>
- After transmission of the virus has occurred, susceptible people move to the exposed class (E), where they spend a number of days equal to the mean period of time between infection and the onset of infectiousness (the latent period).<br/>
- We assume here that the latent period equals the incubation period, or the mean period of time between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms.<br/>

- It is not clear when an individual becomes infectious; thus, we considered two scenarios: 1) the latent period is the same as the incubation period, and 2) the latent period is 2 days shorter than the incubation period, i.e.<br/>
- It has been shown that this estimation depends on the distributions of the latent period (defined as the period between the times when an individual infected and become infectious) and the infectious period .<br/>

# Prevalence of asymptomatic shedding and transmission (e.g., particularly children).

#### Highlights<br/>
- A longer incubation time may lead to a high rate of asymptomatic and subclinical infection among immunocompetent individuals.<br/>
- We assumed that younger individuals are more likely to be asymptomatic (or subclinical) and less infectious (proportion of infectiousness compared to ' , ).<br/>
- As reported by Pan et al , 2 of 3 255 cases was asymptomatic infected, with the proportion of asymptomatic of 0.67.There was a research 256 showed that the asymptomatic infection would shed SARS-CoV-2 for 5 days .<br/>
- Although studies have reported multiple symptoms of hospitalized patients with 2019-nCoV infection 3, 20 , some cases at home might be asymptomatic.<br/>

- Thus, we investigate the relationship between individual-level features of asymptomatic cases (e.g., the probability that an infection is asymptomatic, asymptomatic case duration, transmission by asymptomatic individuals) to dynamics at the population scale.<br/>
- This shows that the prevalence of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals is different from p and 1 − p because prevalence measures the individuals that are currently infectious and does not account for individuals that have already recovered.<br/>
- We note that I a and I s represent prevalence (i.e., the total number of currently infectious individuals) of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals; these quantities are different from i s and i s that we present in the main text, which represent incidence (i.e., the rate at which new cases are generated) of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals.<br/>

# Seasonality of transmission.

#### Highlights<br/>
- A seasonality factor of 0 indicates no seasonal variation in R0 for SARS-CoV-2.<br/>
- A seasonality factor of 0.5 indicates that the amplitude of seasonal variation in R0 for SARS-CoV-2 is half the amplitude of the seasonal variation in R0 for the other betacoronaviruses.<br/>
- A seasonality factor of 1 indicates equal seasonal variation in R0 for SARS-CoV-2 as for the other human betacoronaviruses.<br/>
- A seasonality factor of 1 indicates equivalent seasonal variation in R0, while 0 indicates no seasonal variation (see Table S2 -3).<br/>
- The seasonality factor represents the amount of seasonal variation in the SARS-CoV-2 R0 relative to the other human betacoronaviruses.<br/>

- The seasonality factor represents the amount of seasonal variation in the SARS-CoV-2 R0 relative to the other human betacoronaviruses.<br/>
- This choice was informed by observations on the seasonal variation in R0 for influenza, for which the wintertime R0 was similar between geographic locations with distinct climates, while the summertime R0 varied substantially between locations .<br/>
- To quantify the relative contribution of immunity versus seasonal forcing on the transmission dynamics of the betacoronaviruses, we adopted a regression model that expressed the effective reproduction number for each strain (HKU1 and OC43) as the product of a baseline transmissibility constant (related to the basic reproduction number and the proportion of the population susceptible at the start of the season), the depletion of susceptibles due to infection with the same strain, the depletion of susceptibles due to infection with the other strain, and a spline to capture further unexplained seasonal variation in transmission strength (seasonal forcing).<br/>
- According to a study of geographic variation in the SARS-CoV-2 basic reproduction number across China, seasonal variations in absolute humidity will be insufficient to prevent the widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 .<br/>
- absolute humidity) of seasonal variation in coronavirus transmission have not been identified, we did not include them in our model but .<br/>

- Here we use data on seasonal variation in prevalence of seasonal CoVs in Sweden and model the impact of this variation on the possible future spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere.<br/>
- The seasonal CoVs show a strong and consistent seasonal variation, and modeling suggests that this requires strong variation in transmissibility throughout the year.<br/>
- With these assumptions, we can solve the model and compare the resulting trajectories to the seasonal variation in prevalence of seasonal CoVs, see Fig.<br/>
- We report on the possible influence of seasonal variation on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Northern Hemisphere, in a pandemic scenario.<br/>
- The analysis of seasonal CoV prevalence patterns allowed us to constrain parameter ranges and explore different scenarios of SARS-CoV-2 spread around the globe, in particular in temperate climates like Northern Europe.<br/>
- Here we explore scenarios where temperate regions have a seasonal forcing of between ε = 0.3 and 0.7 and migration rates of 0.01/year.<br/>

- Also, TiO2 coatings can help prevent the proliferation of microbes in atmospheric conditions .<br/>
- TiO2-based materials can also help because they can prevent and inhibit the evolution, reproduction and allow decomposition of the microorganisms if an irradiation source is available in the confinement place.<br/>

*Applied Catalysis B: Environmental - Mar 09, 2020*<br/>
- Several textiles such as cotton, polyester and rayon fibers can be coated or grafted with TiO2 through techniques as sol-gel, reflux, dip-coating, spin-coating and so on .<br/>
- TiO2 powder and coated in a plastic film can be used successfully to increase the storage life of some fruits postharvest .<br/>
- The base formula of a photocatalytic paint consists of powder TiO2 as pigment, some extender pigments such as CaCO3 and silicates, as well as several organic components working as coalescents, dispersing agents, thickeners, additives and a polymeric aqueous suspension, commonly acrylic resins .<br/>
- Suspensions, coatings and thin films can be used to control and prevent microbial infections in hospitals, public places, airports and factories.<br/>
- Single-walled (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have also been used in the formation of composites with titanium dioxide for disinfection process .<br/>
- Also, it can be incorporated into a real water treatment plant as a pre-treatment or secondary disinfection step and as an active antibacterial ceramic in washing machines, clothes, hospital artifacts and auto-cleaning surfaces in restaurants and toilet facilities .<br/>
- The strip of low density glass material allows it to float in the water and the photocatalytic material works using the solar radiation.<br/>
- Apart from silver, copper is a metal widely used in conjunction with TiO2 for antimicrobial purposes.<br/>
- The immobilization of TiO2-based materials in foamed waste-glass strips can be easily achieved by the use of a sonochemical method and can be used in real conditions of algae blooms using natural sunlight .<br/>
- To avoid this issue, the photocatalyst is blended with materials such as silica (SiO2) and apatite that serve as spatial hindrances, thus preventing the decomposition of the fibers .<br/>
- Photoinactivation in viruses has been developed using suspensions, coated sand, films and nanoparticles covered by DNA, although the latter is not attributed to a photocatalytic effect.<br/>
- The cleaning and disinfection of surfaces is another essential use of the photocatalysis.<br/>
- TiO2-based thin films have also been developed as effective photoactive coatings in food processing industries for the removal of Listeria monocytogenes bacterial biofilms .<br/>
- On the other hand, the deposition of metal nanoparticles on the surface of TiO2 also represents an efficient strategy in the photocatalytic improvement of this material.<br/>
- The contact between the metal nanoparticles and the surface of a semiconductor can create an electric field facilitating an interfacial process of electron transfer from the photoexcited semiconductor to the deposited metal, see .<br/>
- Photocatalytic materials based on TiO2 remain as an effective alternative for water disinfection air and surfaces, and can be boosted with some chemicals like ozone, hydrogen peroxide, and so on.<br/>
- For production of graphene, several procedures have been used to carry out the exfoliation of the π-stacked carbon layers such as the chemical vapor deposition and the micromechanical cleavage of graphite .<br/>
- In this sense, graphene/TiO2 and reduced graphene oxide/TiO2 have been used in disinfection process of water contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms .<br/>
- Other TiO2-based nanostructures, such as titanate nanotubes, have also been used in disinfection processes .<br/>
- For instance, silicone and latex catheters, medical tubes and any medical-grade surface can be coated by TiO2 and Ag-TiO2 for the elimination of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, which are the pathogenic J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f microorganisms commonly associated with nosocomial infections .<br/>
- Silver-TiO2 composites are commonly prepared by photoreduction under UV light, sol-gel method and incipient wet-impregnation .<br/>
- Another eco-friendly application that can be exploited commercially is the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f coating of textile materials with photoactive materials that help to deodorize and eliminate pathogenic microorganisms.<br/>
- The merchandising of TiO2 based photocatalytic paints has also exploited the disinfection properties of the semiconductor .<br/>

# Natural history of the virus and shedding of it from an infected person

#### Highlights<br/>
- After an individual is exposed, the transmission of virus particles from one person to another will make an "exposed" person become "infected".<br/>
- Currently, person to person transmission from patients with pneumonia or even asymptomatic patients during the incubation period are the main conduits for the spread of the infection .<br/>
- The basic reproduction number, R 0 , which is the number of persons infected by the transmission of a pathogen from one infected person during the infectious time, is given by<br/>
- Usually, COVID-19 has an incubation period of 2-7 days 2 with no obvious 41 symptoms, during which time the virus can spread from infected to uninfected individuals.<br/>

*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- The rationalization of pharmaceutical manufacturing and the control strategies can be derived from a better knowledge of the product and process.<br/>
- In this context, considerable efforts have been made from Regulatory Authorities and professional associations to improve the quality in the pharmaceutical processes to minimize the risk for the patients and improve the effectiveness of the manufacturing processes (ISPE, 2014; PDA, 2014; EMA, 2019c; Various Associations, 2019b) .<br/>
- The application of a modern pharmaceutical quality system promotes a systematic and continuous evaluation, understanding and refining of the formulation and the manufacturing process by the identification of the critical material attributes and process parameters and by the determination of the existing functional relationship between such factors and the responses (i.e.<br/>
- The traditional quality control process has been generally based on the testing of most critical parameters and manufacturing steps can impact on the quality of the intermediates or the final medicinal product.<br/>
- However, for low-and medium-impact products, the development of protocols to rationalize the clinical medicine substitution or to activate importation procedures may be more effective.<br/>
- To mitigate the risk of quality-failures, the EMA promoted the application of the quality-by-design and quality risk assessment principles to the manufacturing of medicinal products (EMA, 2015a (EMA, ,b, 2017 .<br/>
- Economic incentives to MAHs producing medicinal products can be provided as cut-off of the regulatory costs/times to implement the quality in their manufacturing process and to improve their resilience to production blockage.<br/>
- If such tools are strongly necessary for highshortage-impact products, their adoption as a preventive action to monitor medium-and low-impact products is also desirable.<br/>
- However, effective pharmaceutical quality systems require close collaboration between the MAH and their suppliers of raw materials to promote a more rational definition of the critical quality attributes of the drug product and to improve the production resilience.<br/>
- For these considerations, the adoption of the preventing tools proposed by the stakeholders' associations (PDA, 2014; ISPE, 2014) could be carried out gradually by the MAHs based on both the shortage impact of a product on the treated patients and the economic sustainability for the MAHs production.<br/>

# Tools and studies to monitor phenotypic change and potential adaptation of the virus

#### Highlights<br/>
- To facilitate the examination of how genetic variations could impact the immune vulnerability landscape of the viruses, we also showed the mutational rates of the viral genome along with the immunogenicity maps.<br/>
- Hence, to minimize the impact of emerging viral diseases, it is critical to establish local laboratory capacity as this plays a critical role in the surveillance, diagnosis, and monitoring of viral disease, as well as in the understanding of the viral genetic changes.<br/>
- Further investigations are needed to understand clinical course, immunologic response, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, virus culture, and transmission, to inform clinical management and public health strategies to prevent disease spread.<br/>
- We hope that these insights may help to mitigate the global impacts of COVID-19 by guiding effective decision-making in both high-and low-resource countries, and may contribute to prospective improvements in screening policy for future emerging infections.<br/>
- To connect this development to health care, diagnostic tools that target the entire species should complement existing tools that detect individual pathogenic variants.<br/>

# Immune response and immunity

#### Highlights<br/>
- Innate immunity is the first arm of immune response to viral infections.<br/>
- It is also required for programming functional adaptive immune responses and, therefore, coordinates the entire host immune response to infection .<br/>
- In the antiviral immune response, cellular immunity (including T cells and NK cells) plays a central role, while humoral immunity plays a coordinating role.<br/>
- The immune response to different pathological invasions in the human body is mediated by two arms; innate and acquired immunity.<br/>
- 2, 3 Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, a high viral load and overexuberant host immune response involving innate and acquired immunity, simultaneously contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and organ injury.<br/>

-  Because of the extent of community spread, traditional public health measures might not be able to halt all human-to-human transmission, and we need to consider moving from containment to mitigation.<br/>
- In the absence of vaccines and specific treatment, the only available public health tools to control persontoperson transmittable diseases are isolation and quarantine, social distancing, and community containment measures.<br/>
- If this approach is not feasible because of widespread community transmission, then community quarantine is also needed with rigorous implementation of social distancing.<br/>
- 10 These interventions range from measures to encourage personal responsibility to identify disease, increase social distancing among community members including cancellation of public gatherings, and finally implement community quarantine.<br/>
