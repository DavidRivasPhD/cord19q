# Range of incubation periods for the disease in humans (and how this varies across age and health status) and how long individuals are contagious, even after recovery.

#### Highlights<br/>
- The incubation period is generally 3-7 days (within 14 days) .<br/>
- The incubation period is the time from infection to the onset of the disease.<br/>
- The median incubation period was 3.0 days (range, 0 to 24.0).<br/>
- Regarding the disease course, the median incubation period was 10.50 (7.75 -25.25) days.<br/>
- 10 The average incubation period is 5 days, but it ranges from 1 to 14 days.<br/>

- Depending on how much time has passed since exposure to the primary infected individual, those infected may not yet be symptomatic -this period of time between infection and symptoms is an important epidemiological trait of an infectious disease called the incubation period.<br/>
- Upon infection, individuals progress through a latent period before onset of infectiousness; during the duration of infectiousness, the relative infectiousness follows a triangular distribution.<br/>
- The longer serial interval in scenario 2 (mean = 7.5 days) resulted in slower disease dynamics: mean duration of infectiousness 4.8 days [95% CI 1.12, 10.5]; mean time of peak relative infectiousness at 38% of the duration of infectiousness [0%, 97%]; and a mean time of infectiousness onset 0.51 days after symptom onset [0.77 days before, 1.50 after] (Table 2, Figure S2 ).<br/>
- The time of symptom onset is measured as the difference between the incubation and latent periods, with negative values indicating presymptomatic infectiousness.<br/>

- It is not clear when an individual becomes infectious; thus, we considered two scenarios: 1) the latent period is the same as the incubation period, and 2) the latent period is 2 days shorter than the incubation period, i.e.<br/>
- It has been shown that this estimation depends on the distributions of the latent period (defined as the period between the times when an individual infected and become infectious) and the infectious period .<br/>

- Thus, we investigate the relationship between individual-level features of asymptomatic cases (e.g., the probability that an infection is asymptomatic, asymptomatic case duration, transmission by asymptomatic individuals) to dynamics at the population scale.<br/>
- This shows that the prevalence of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals is different from p and 1 − p because prevalence measures the individuals that are currently infectious and does not account for individuals that have already recovered.<br/>

- Clinical illness correlated with the presence of viral RNA in upper airway samples (Figure 1) , with no evidence of prolonged asymptomatic shedding, although discordance between nose and throat samples in case B highlights the need to sample both areas.<br/>
- Co-occurrence of respiratory viral infection, as we observed in case B with rhinovirus, has been described in the context of SARS-CoV-2 (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022327v1) as it has with many other respiratory viruses spread by similar routes, and may have contributed to the increased symptomatology in case B. Interestingly the partner of case A, who was a close household contact, remained asymptomatic throughout and had negative tests for SARS-CoV-2 shedding.<br/>

# Seasonality of transmission.

#### Highlights<br/>
- A seasonality factor of 0 indicates no seasonal variation in R0 for SARS-CoV-2.<br/>
- A seasonality factor of 0.5 indicates that the amplitude of seasonal variation in R0 for SARS-CoV-2 is half the amplitude of the seasonal variation in R0 for the other betacoronaviruses.<br/>
- Data from the southern hemisphere will assist in evaluating how much seasonality will influence COVID-19 transmission.<br/>
- Transmissibility of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Chinese cities with different transmission dynamics of imported cases<br/>
- The superposition of many such subpopulations with a range of R 0 values and seasonal variation in transmission will result in dynamics that are qualitatively different from a single population SIR model.<br/>

- With these assumptions, we can solve the model and compare the resulting trajectories to the seasonal variation in prevalence of seasonal CoVs, see Fig.<br/>
- The analysis of seasonal CoV prevalence patterns allowed us to constrain parameter ranges and explore different scenarios of SARS-CoV-2 spread around the globe, in particular in temperate climates like Northern Europe.<br/>
- We report on the possible influence of seasonal variation on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Northern Hemisphere, in a pandemic scenario.<br/>
- An R 0 ≈ 3 in winter in Hubei and a seasonal forcing of ε = 0.4 implies an annual average R 0 = β 0 /ν = 2.2.<br/>
- Here we explore scenarios where temperate regions have a seasonal forcing of between ε = 0.3 and 0.7 and migration rates of 0.01/year.<br/>
- These two scenarios differ slightly in the time of year at which peak transmissibility θ occurs: When transmission is mostly local and seasonality is amplified by .<br/>
-  Seasonal forcing ε was drawn from a uniform distribution between 0.25 and 0.75 for temperate regions, .<br/>
- The superposition of many such subpopulations with a range of R 0 values and seasonal variation in transmission will result in dynamics that are qualitatively different from a single population SIR model.<br/>
- We also explore different scenarios of SARS-CoV-2 spread in temperate and tropical regions and show how variation in epidemiological parameters affects a potential pandemic and the possibility of transitioning to an endemic state.<br/>
-  showing that recent trends in different regions across East-Asia imply that seasonality alone is unlikely to end SARS-CoV-2 spread.<br/>
- The qualitative behavior is robust to model perturbations and parameter variation as long as seasonal forcing is strong.<br/>

- A seasonality factor of 0 indicates no seasonal variation in R0 for SARS-CoV-2.<br/>
- A seasonality factor of 0.5 indicates that the amplitude of seasonal variation in R0 for SARS-CoV-2 is half the amplitude of the seasonal variation in R0 for the other betacoronaviruses.<br/>
- This choice was informed by observations on the seasonal variation in R0 for influenza, for which the wintertime R0 was similar between geographic locations with distinct climates, while the summertime R0 varied substantially between locations .<br/>
- We assumed that the spline coefficients were constant across all seasons though seasonal forcing likely differed from year to year based on underlying drivers.<br/>
- We summarized the post-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 dynamics into the categories of annual outbreaks, biennial outbreaks, sporadic outbreaks, or virtual elimination.<br/>
- A modelling study using data from Sweden also found that seasonal establishment of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is likely in the post-pandemic period .<br/>

- The aim of the photoactive materials is to have an antimicrobial activity respectful with the environment that helps to prevent the disinfection, the inactivation or the destruction of microorganisms avoiding the generation of microbial resistance.<br/>
- In factor not well considered that modifies the control mechanisms, due to the diversity of microorganisms in real water, nutrient-rich environments and wastewater discharges in addition the incorporation of scavenger/strong oxidants .<br/>
- The cleaning and disinfection of surfaces is another essential use of the photocatalysis.<br/>
- Unraveling the interactions between the TiO2-based materials and the cell wall of the microorganisms will certainly benefit the precise control and prevention of the proliferation of pathogens.<br/>
- Also, TiO2 coatings can help prevent the proliferation of microbes in atmospheric conditions .<br/>
- All the possible variety of resistance mechanisms and the variability of the composition of the environment that could interact negatively the inhibition with nanoparticles, such as the C. parvum tested with TiO2 in wastewater , makes it difficult to establish a safe concentration and interaction time.<br/>
- The recovery of the nanomaterials and/or proper disposal is also necessary.<br/>
- The protection of the soil biodiversity is quite important to ensure a sustainable control of microorganisms and to avoid harmful products.<br/>
- The near-neutral photo-Fenton processes also decrease the effectiveness of microbial inactivation.<br/>
- In this sense, graphene/TiO2 and reduced graphene oxide/TiO2 have been used in disinfection process of water contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms .<br/>
- In this review, these strategies are analyzed to elucidate the enhanced photocatalytic features of TiO2 in the disinfection processes of pathogenic and model microorganisms.<br/>
- TiO2-based materials can also help because they can prevent and inhibit the evolution, reproduction and allow decomposition of the microorganisms if an irradiation source is available in the confinement place.<br/>

*Applied Catalysis B: Environmental - Mar 09, 2020*<br/>
- Several textiles such as cotton, polyester and rayon fibers can be coated or grafted with TiO2 through techniques as sol-gel, reflux, dip-coating, spin-coating and so on .<br/>
- TiO2 powder and coated in a plastic film can be used successfully to increase the storage life of some fruits postharvest .<br/>
- Apart from silver, copper is a metal widely used in conjunction with TiO2 for antimicrobial purposes.<br/>
- Also, it can be incorporated into a real water treatment plant as a pre-treatment or secondary disinfection step and as an active antibacterial ceramic in washing machines, clothes, hospital artifacts and auto-cleaning surfaces in restaurants and toilet facilities .<br/>
- The base formula of a photocatalytic paint consists of powder TiO2 as pigment, some extender pigments such as CaCO3 and silicates, as well as several organic components working as coalescents, dispersing agents, thickeners, additives and a polymeric aqueous suspension, commonly acrylic resins .<br/>
- The preparation of self-organized TiO2 nanotube arrays is usually carried out through a conventional anodization process using titanium foil as substrate .<br/>
- Suspensions, coatings and thin films can be used to control and prevent microbial infections in hospitals, public places, airports and factories.<br/>
- The strip of low density glass material allows it to float in the water and the photocatalytic material works using the solar radiation.<br/>
- The contact between the metal nanoparticles and the surface of a semiconductor can create an electric field facilitating an interfacial process of electron transfer from the photoexcited semiconductor to the deposited metal, see .<br/>
- On the other hand, the deposition of metal nanoparticles on the surface of TiO2 also represents an efficient strategy in the photocatalytic improvement of this material.<br/>
- The immobilization of TiO2-based materials in foamed waste-glass strips can be easily achieved by the use of a sonochemical method and can be used in real conditions of algae blooms using natural sunlight .<br/>
- The cleaning and disinfection of surfaces is another essential use of the photocatalysis.<br/>
- To avoid this issue, the photocatalyst is blended with materials such as silica (SiO2) and apatite that serve as spatial hindrances, thus preventing the decomposition of the fibers .<br/>
- Single-walled (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have also been used in the formation of composites with titanium dioxide for disinfection process .<br/>
- Furthermore, working with TiO2 coatings on mesoporous support materials can also be considered as a practical methodology.<br/>
- Another eco-friendly application that can be exploited commercially is the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f coating of textile materials with photoactive materials that help to deodorize and eliminate pathogenic microorganisms.<br/>
- Photocatalytic materials based on TiO2 remain as an effective alternative for water disinfection air and surfaces, and can be boosted with some chemicals like ozone, hydrogen peroxide, and so on.<br/>
- Silver-TiO2 composites are commonly prepared by photoreduction under UV light, sol-gel method and incipient wet-impregnation .<br/>
- In this sense, the photogenerated electrons in TiO2 can be transferred and stored in the carbon nanotubes (CNTs).<br/>
- For production of graphene, several procedures have been used to carry out the exfoliation of the π-stacked carbon layers such as the chemical vapor deposition and the micromechanical cleavage of graphite .<br/>
- J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Among the metals deposited in TiO2, silver in one of the most interesting.<br/>
- Photoinactivation in viruses has been developed using suspensions, coated sand, films and nanoparticles covered by DNA, although the latter is not attributed to a photocatalytic effect.<br/>

# Natural history of the virus and shedding of it from an infected person

#### Highlights<br/>
-  During the transmission of virus, the probability of infection in contact with each person is equal.<br/>
- Currently, person to person transmission from patients with pneumonia or even asymptomatic patients during the incubation period are the main conduits for the spread of the infection .<br/>
- After an individual is exposed, the transmission of virus particles from one person to another will make an "exposed" person become "infected".<br/>
- Usually, COVID-19 has an incubation period of 2-7 days 2 with no obvious 41 symptoms, during which time the virus can spread from infected to uninfected individuals.<br/>
- The transmission of 2019-nCoV is often spread from person to person through the respiratory droplets generated during coughs or sneezes from an infected person.<br/>

*Microbes and Infection - Mar 31, 2020*<br/>
- 2019-nCoV is thought to be transmitted through droplets, close contact, aerosol and maybe fecal-oral transmission, and patients in the incubation period can transmit the virus to other persons .<br/>
- Therefore, besides respiratory and bodily contact, fecal-oral transmission is a potential route for 2019-nCoV infection .<br/>
- Indeed, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats, the natural reservoir, but transmitted to humans via intermediate host civets and camels, respectively.<br/>

*One Health - Mar 16, 2020*<br/>
- In the light of the One Health concept, control of this emerging virus requires the reduction of the viral shedding to the environment from the main reservoirs, for animal-person transmission and from humans for person-person transmission .<br/>
- Therefore, it reduces the possibility of virus shedding from the infected patients to its close contacts.<br/>
- However, there are ongoing debates about the possibility of infected persons to shed the virus early during the course of an infection with this virus even before the appearance of the clinical signs .<br/>

*Infectious Diseases of Poverty - 2020*<br/>
- We simulated the natural history of the infection that the proportion of asymptomatic infection was 50%, and the transmissibility of asymptomatic infection was half of that of symptomatic infection, which were different to those of MERS and SARS.<br/>
- We assumed that the virus transmitted among the bats, and then transmitted to unknown hosts (probably some wild animals).<br/>
- This means that the transmission route was mainly from person to person rather than from reservoir to person in the early stage of the transmission in Wuhan City.<br/>

*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- In this context, considerable efforts have been made from Regulatory Authorities and professional associations to improve the quality in the pharmaceutical processes to minimize the risk for the patients and improve the effectiveness of the manufacturing processes (ISPE, 2014; PDA, 2014; EMA, 2019c; Various Associations, 2019b) .<br/>
- The rationalization of pharmaceutical manufacturing and the control strategies can be derived from a better knowledge of the product and process.<br/>
- The application of a modern pharmaceutical quality system promotes a systematic and continuous evaluation, understanding and refining of the formulation and the manufacturing process by the identification of the critical material attributes and process parameters and by the determination of the existing functional relationship between such factors and the responses (i.e.<br/>
- To mitigate the risk of quality-failures, the EMA promoted the application of the quality-by-design and quality risk assessment principles to the manufacturing of medicinal products (EMA, 2015a (EMA, ,b, 2017 .<br/>
- Economic incentives to MAHs producing medicinal products can be provided as cut-off of the regulatory costs/times to implement the quality in their manufacturing process and to improve their resilience to production blockage.<br/>
- If such tools are strongly necessary for highshortage-impact products, their adoption as a preventive action to monitor medium-and low-impact products is also desirable.<br/>
- However, effective pharmaceutical quality systems require close collaboration between the MAH and their suppliers of raw materials to promote a more rational definition of the critical quality attributes of the drug product and to improve the production resilience.<br/>
- However, for low-and medium-impact products, the development of protocols to rationalize the clinical medicine substitution or to activate importation procedures may be more effective.<br/>
- For these considerations, the adoption of the preventing tools proposed by the stakeholders' associations (PDA, 2014; ISPE, 2014) could be carried out gradually by the MAHs based on both the shortage impact of a product on the treated patients and the economic sustainability for the MAHs production.<br/>

# Immune response and immunity

#### Highlights<br/>
- Innate immunity is the first arm of immune response to viral infections.<br/>
- It is also required for programming functional adaptive immune responses and, therefore, coordinates the entire host immune response to infection .<br/>
- In the antiviral immune response, cellular immunity (including T cells and NK cells) plays a central role, while humoral immunity plays a coordinating role.<br/>
- The immune response to different pathological invasions in the human body is mediated by two arms; innate and acquired immunity.<br/>
- 2, 3 Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, a high viral load and overexuberant host immune response involving innate and acquired immunity, simultaneously contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and organ injury.<br/>
