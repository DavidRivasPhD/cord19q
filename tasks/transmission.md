Match (0.4842): **The total population (N) consists of seven classes: susceptible (S), exposed but not infectious (E), first infectious class (I 1 ), second infectious class (I 2 ), hospitalized (H), recovered (R), or dead (D). Individ-uals are considered susceptible until they contact an infectious individual from (I 1 ), (I 2 ), or (H). Given contact with an infectious individual, transmission takes place with some probability. After transmission of the virus has occurred, susceptible people move to the exposed class (E), where they spend a number of days equal to the mean period of time between infection and the onset of infectiousness (the latent period). We assume here that the latent period equals the incubation period, or the mean period of time between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms. After the latent period, they move to the first infectious class (I 1 ). The mean duration of the first infectious period differs according to the underlying virus. Symptoms worsen for some proportion of the first infectious class, who enter the hospital (H), where they remain infectious. Individuals who do not enter the hospital remain ill outside the hospital for the duration of the second infectious period (I 2 ). From (I 2 ), the length of which differs according to the underlying virus, where we assume that the progression of the illness is not severe, individuals recover. The duration of hospitalization differs according to the underlying virus. From the hospital, individuals either recover (R) or die (D). We assume that hospitalized individuals have 75% less contact with susceptible individuals, which results in 75% reduced transmission during hospitalization. We further assume that recovered individuals (R) gain full immunity to the virus causing the illness.

Different infectious diseases have different incubation periods. However, for a certain infectious disease, its incubation period is relatively fixed. Since the number of pathogens entering the body, virulence and reproductive capacity, as well as power of resistance are different for different people, thus, it is reported that the incubation periods obtained from patients for a certain disease should follow logarithm normal distribution [16, 33] . Generally, incubation period can be measured by physiological observations and biological experiments [33] .

Match (0.5132): **Although information on COVID-19 has increased rapidly since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, many issues remain unresolved. First, the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 ranges from the asymptomatic carrier 19 state to severe pneumonia; however, most early reports only showed the findings of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, in which the ratio of male patients was much larger than that of female patients, there were no pediatric cases, and the mortality rate was high. [12] [13] [14] Subsequent to the publication of the studies of patients with only ARD or mild pneumonia, we found the ratio of male-to-female patients decreased, children or neonates could contract COVID-19, and the mortality rate declined compared to that of previous reports. 8, 11 However, whether children were less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, or their presentation was mostly asymptomatic or difficult to detect, remains unclear. 49 In addition, most studies, especially those with a large patient population, were conducted in China, and the study of asymptomatic carriers was limited. More studies are needed to clarify the epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 and to identify the risk and prognostic factors of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Second, Zou et al. reported that the viral load detected in asymptomatic patients was similar to that found in symptomatic patients; however, the viral loads from patients with severe diseases were higher than those in patients with mild-to-moderate presentations. Moreover, higher viral loads were detected in the nose than in the throat. 50 As there is a concern of virus spread due to severe cough 20 induced by performing a throat swab, nasal swab may be a relatively safe and sensitive alternative to collect the respiratory specimen of patients with COVID-19. However, this study involved a population of only 18 patients, including one asymptomatic patient. 49 In addition, every test has its own limitation and sensitivity/specificity; however, the studies investigating the **<br/>

Match (0.5031): **(3) There is important uncertainty around the proportion of asymptomatic infections. Currently, the detection of asymptomatic patients in China is limited by the focus on symptomatic patients seeking care and the lack of seroprevalence data [18] . The proportion of symptomatic infections has been estimated to 58% (95% confidence interval: 33-83) in a small sample of cases exported to Japan [19] . During the outbreak on the ship "Diamond Princess", nearly all individuals were tested regardless of symptoms, leading to an average proportion of symptomatic infections of 49% in a sample size of 619, which was used in the present study [13] . Still, uncertainty about the proportion of symptomatic infections will remain until a large retrospective seroprevalence study is conducted in the general population, and our results are dependent on this estimate. Additionally, the dichotomization of infection into asymptomatic and symptomatic is a simplification of reality; the infection with SARS-CoV-2, will likely cause a gradient of symptoms in different individuals depending on age, sex and comorbidities [10] . The proportion of asymptomatic infections might show an age-dependent structure.**<br/>

Match (0.5030): **Our work has several limitations. (1) Our results depend on the central assumption that the cause of the deficit of reported cases among younger age groups is a surveillance bias and does not reflect a lower risk of infection in younger individuals. The reason for this age shift is unknown [10] . Retrospective testing for COVID-19 of samples from influenza-like-illness surveillance found no positive test among children, but the sample sizes were small (20 per week including both adults and children) [10] . Uneven age distributions in the risk of infection can be attributed to immunological features, such as the lower circulation of H1N1 influenza in older individuals due to residual immunity [17] . An immunological explanation of the opposite phenomenon, with a lower susceptibility of younger individuals, seems unlikely, and there is no indication of pre-existing immunity to COVID-19 in humans [10] . Different contact patterns could play a role in a limited outbreak, but not in such a widespread infection, especially as household transmission seems to play a major role [10] . The last explanation that we assume here is that younger individuals, when symptomatic, have milder symptoms that decrease the probability of seeking care and being identified.**<br/>

Reviewing data from active surveillance of passengers on cruise ships or repatriation flights, we estimate that up to half of cases show no detectable symptoms at the time of diagnosis. To complicate matters further, the fraction of subclinical cases may vary across age groups. Children and young adults have been conspicuously underrepresented, even in very large clinical data sets  The Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team, 2020; Huang et al., 2020; . Only 2.1% of the first 44,672 confirmed cases were observed in children under 20 years of age (The Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team, 2020). The possibility cannot be ruled out that large numbers of subclinical cases are occurring in young people. If an age-by-severity interaction does indeed exist, then the mean age of travellers should be taken into account when estimating screening effectiveness.**<br/>

Match (0.4916): **One possible reason is that children have fewer outdoor activities and undertake less international travel, making them less likely to contract the virus. The number of pediatric patients may increase in the future and a lower number of pediatric patients at the beginning of a pandemic does not necessarily mean that children are less susceptible to the infection. In fact, infants can be infected by SARS-CoV-2. 8 During the 1918 outbreak of "Spanish flu," those 65 years old and children 15 years experienced little or no change in excess mortality as compared with that of the previous influenza season. Nevertheless, those aged 15e24 and 25e44 years experienced sharply elevated death rates. 9 Similarly, at the beginning of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza outbreak, the percentage age distributions for mortality and morbidity for patients with severe pneumonia show a marked shift to persons between the ages of 5 and 59 years, as compared with distributions observed during previous periods of epidemic influenza. 10 On the other hand, several infectious diseases are well known to be less severe in children. Paralytic polio occurred in approximately 1 in 1000 infections among infants, in contrast to approximately 1 in 100 infections among adolescents. 11 As compared with young children, teenagers and adults tend to have symptomatic rubella more frequently and have systemic manifestations. 11 The overall casefatality rate of severe respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) ranges from 7% to 17%. Persons with underlying medical conditions and those older than 65 years of age had mortality rates as high as 50%. However, there was no mortality in children or in adults younger than the age of 24 years. 11 The reasons for the relative resistance of children to some infectious diseases remains obscure. It was suggested that maturational changes in the axonal transport system may explain the relative resistance of immature mice to poliovirus-induced paralysis. 12 Other suggested reasons include children having a more active innate immune response, healthier respiratory tracts because they have not been exposed to as much cigarette smoke and air pollution as adults, and fewer underlying disorders. A more vigorous immune response in adults may also explain a detrimental immune response that is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. 11 A difference in the distribution, maturation, and functioning of viral receptors is frequently mentioned as a possible reason of the age-related difference in incidence. The SARS virus, SARS-CoV-2, and human coronavirus-NL63 (HCoV-NL63) all use the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor in humans. 13, 14 Previous studies demonstrated that HCoV-NL63 infection is more common in adults than in children. 15, 16 This finding suggests there may indeed be relative resistance to SARS-CoV-2 in children.**<br/>

Match (0.4879): **In both MERS and SARS outbreaks, children were less likely to develop severe respiratory distress seen in adults, experiencing a pneumonia or common cold symptoms. [7] [8] [9] Exposure of young children in China to other coronaviruses, such as OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1, 17 may impart some immunity not reinforced in older individuals, explaining partial protection against COVID-19 in this population. 18, 19 Comorbidities have been reported to be associated with severity of COVID-19 infection. 20, 21 As children generally have less comorbidities, this may also in part explain the lack of serious infections in children and contribute to decreased detection. Moreover, behavioral differences and limited travel as compared to adults may have also explained the limited number of cases early in the outbreak. 5 In our data set, children under 10 years old made up a near equal proportion of included cases. This is different than data presented in a recent Chinese CDC report which showed a slightly greater number of cases in those over age 10 (416 aged 0-9 vs. 549 aged 10-19). 6 Whether this is due to the availability of cases in the line lists or a higher detection of cases in young children outside China is unclear, however, this should be monitored going forward. In general, infants and young children are often at increased risk of poor outcomes from respiratory infections, 22 which has not yet been witnessed with COVID-19 from reported aggregate data. 6 Interestingly, a significant male skew in cases was observed in pediatric patients throughout the analysis. This sex skew was not observed among children in SARS or MERS.

Second, it is worth noting that the data of passengers and crews employed in our analysis is not a random sample from the general population. Considering that most of the passengers are 60 years and older, the nature of this age distribution may lead to underestimation if older individuals tend to experience more symptoms. An age standardized asymptomatic proportion would be more appropriate in that case. Third, the presence of symptoms in cases with COVID-19 may correlate with other factors unrelated to age including prior health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, immunosuppression. Therefore, more detailed data documenting the baseline health of the individuals including the presence of underlying diseases or comorbidities would be useful to remove the bias in estimates of the asymptomatic proportion.**<br/>

Match (0.5488): **With these assumptions, we can solve the model and compare the resulting trajectories to the seasonal variation in prevalence of seasonal CoVs, see Fig. 2 . In Stockholm, seasonal variation of CoVs (especially HKU1/OC43) is very consistent across years (see Fig. S3 ). We therefore fit the SIER model to the average seasonal variation across years by calculating the squared deviation of observed and predicted prevalence relative to their respective mean values. Simulations of the model are compatible with observations in two separate regions of parameter space: If Northern Europe was very isolated with less than 1 in 1,000 susceptible individuals returning with a seasonal CoV infection from abroad each year, weak seasonality of around ε = 0.15 would be sufficient to generate strong variation through the year compatible with observations (Fig. 2 , bottom-left ridge). In this regime, prevalence is oscillating intrinsically with a period that is commensurate with annual seasonal oscillations giving rise to a resonance phenomenon with annual or biennial patterns even for weak seasonal forcing (Chen and Epureanu, 2017; Dushoff et al., 2004) .**<br/>

Match (0.5324): **To quantify the relative contribution of immunity versus seasonal forcing on the transmission dynamics of the betacoronaviruses, we adopted a regression model (22) that expressed the effective reproduction number for each strain (HKU1 and OC43) as the product of a baseline transmissibility constant (related to the basic reproduction number and the proportion of the population susceptible at the start of the season), the depletion of susceptibles due to infection with the same strain, the depletion of susceptibles due to infection with the other strain, and a spline to capture further unexplained seasonal variation in transmission strength (seasonal forcing). These covariates were able to explain most of the observed variability in the effective reproduction numbers (adjusted R 2 : 74.2%). The estimated multiplicative effects of .

Match (0.5319): **Our observations are consistent with other predictions of how the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak might unfold. According to a study of geographic variation in the SARS-CoV-2 basic reproduction number across China, seasonal variations in absolute humidity will be insufficient to prevent the widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (26) . A modelling study using data from Sweden also found that seasonal establishment of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is likely in the post-pandemic period (10).**<br/>

Match (0.5247): **Next, we incorporated a third strain into the dynamic transmission model to represent SARS-CoV-2. Using the maximum likelihood parameter values, we simulated transmission of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 for 20 years and then simulated the establishment of sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission using another half-week pulse in the force of infection. We assumed that the incubation period and infectious period for SARS-CoV-2 were the same as the best-fit values for the other betacoronaviruses (5.0 and 4.9 days, respectively; see Table S7 ), in broad agreement with other estimates (23) (24) (25) . We allowed the cross immunities, duration of immunity, degree of seasonal variation in R0, and establishment time of SARS-CoV-2 to vary. In particular, we allowed the cross immunity from SARS-CoV-2 to the other betacoronaviruses to range from 0 to 1, the cross immunity from the other betacoronaviruses to SARS-CoV-2 to range from 0 to 0.5 (following the observation that SARS infection can induce long-lasting neutralizing antibodies against HCoV-OC43 but not vice-versa (15)),the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 to range from 40 weeks to permanent, the seasonal variation in R0 to vary between none and equivalent to the other human betacoronaviruses, and the establishment time to vary throughout 2020. To adjust the amount of seasonal variation in R0, we held the maximum wintertime value of the sinusoid fixed and adjusted the minimum summertime (baseline) value. This way, smaller degrees of seasonal forcing translated into smaller summertime declines in R0; for the no-seasonality scenario, R0 was therefore held fixed at its maximal wintertime value. This choice was informed by observations on the seasonal variation in R0 for influenza, for which the wintertime R0 was similar between geographic locations with distinct climates, while the summertime R0 varied substantially between locations (11) . For a representative set of parameter values within these ranges, we measured the annual incidence of infection due to SARS-CoV-2 and the annual SARS-CoV-2 outbreak peak size for the five years following the simulated time of establishment. We summarized the post-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 dynamics into the categories of annual outbreaks, biennial outbreaks, sporadic outbreaks, or virtual elimination.**<br/>

Match (0.5061): **The seasonal CoVs show a strong and consistent seasonal variation, and modeling suggests that this requires strong variation in transmissibility throughout the year. It should be noted, however, that SARS-CoV-2 does seem to transmit in tropical climates like Singapore, and so winter is not a necessary condition of SARS-CoV-2 spread. Furthermore, our models are compatible with work by Luo et al. (2020) showing that recent trends in different regions across East-Asia imply that seasonality alone is unlikely to end SARS-CoV-2 spread. Precise values for the underlying model parameters and the effect of infection control measures are currently unavailable. For this reason we explored a range of parameter values to assess the robustness of the results to model assumptions.**<br/>

Match (0.5628): **In addition to population mobility and human-to-human contact, environmental factors can impact droplet transmission and survival of viruses (e.g., influenza) but have not yet been examined for this novel pathogen. Absolute humidity, defined as the water content in ambient air, has been found to be a strong environmental determinant of other viral transmissions (4, 5) . For example, influenza viruses survive longer on surfaces or in droplets in cold and dry air -increasing the likelihood of subsequent transmission. Thus, it is key to understand the effects of environmental factors on the ongoing outbreak to support decision-making pertaining to disease control. Especially in locations where the risk of transmission may have been underestimated, such as in humid and warmer locations.**<br/>

Data on the transmissibility of coronaviruses from contaminated surfaces to hands were not found. However, it could be shown with influenza A virus that a 5 s contact is sufficient to transfer 31.6% of the viral load to the hands [9] . The transfer efficiency was lower with parainfluenza-virus 3 (1.5%) [10] . Although the viral load of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces is not known during an outbreak situation it seems plausible to reduce the viral load on surfaces by disinfection, especially on frequent touch surfaces in the immediate patient surrounding where the highest viral load can be expected.**<br/>

Thus, surface sanitization of the apparel before they are taken off may also help reduce the infection risk for medical staff.

Moreover, a latest pilot experiment showed that 4 out of 62 stool specimens tested positive to 2019-nCoV, and another four patients in a separate cohort who tested positive to rectal swabs had the 2019-nCoV being detected in the gastrointestinal tract, saliva, or urine 20 . Thus, our results support that in addition to the respiratory droplets and direct contact, fecal-oral transmission might also be the route of transmission of 2019-nCoV.**<br/>

Match (0.6122): **The use of rubber dams can significantly minimize the production of saliva-and blood-contaminated aerosol or spatter, particularly in cases when high-speed handpieces and dental ultrasonic devices are used. It has been reported that the use of rubber dam could significantly reduce airborne particles in~3-foot diameter of the operational field by 70% 58 . When rubber dam is applied, extra high-volume suction for aerosol and spatter should be used during the procedures along with regular suction 59 . In this case, the implementation of a complete four-hand operation is also necessary. If rubber dam isolation is not possible in some cases, manual devices, such as Carisolv and hand scaler, are recommended for caries removal and periodontal scaling, in order to minimize the generation of aerosol as much as possible.**<br/>

Match (0.6034): **MSAs in general have higher concentration of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol with biomodal size distributions compared to PAA in both hospitals during the first batch of sampling in the peak of COVID-19 outbreak. For Renmin Hospital sampling sites, the air circulation in MSA by design is isolated from that of the patient rooms. While for Fangcang Hospital, the nonventilated temporary PARR has limited air penetration from the patient hall where the SARS-CoV-2 aerosol concentration was generally low. We believe one direct source of the high SARS-CoV-2 aerosol concentration may be the resuspension of virus-laden aerosol from the surface of medical staff protective apparel while they are being removed. These resuspended virus-laden aerosol originally may come from the direct deposition of respiratory droplets or virus-laden aerosol onto the protective apparel while medical staff having long working hours inside PAA, as shown from the SARS-CoV-2 deposition results in ICU room. Another possible source is the resuspension of floor dust aerosol containing virus that were transferred from PAA to MSA. The two virus-laden aerosol sources also appear to correspond to the sub-and supermicron peaks found in size-segregated samples. We hypothesize the submicron aerosol may come from the resuspension of virus-laden aerosol from staff apparel due to its higher mobility while the supermicron virus-laden aerosol may come from the resuspension of dust particles from the floors or other hard surfaces. The findings suggest virus-laden aerosols could first deposit on the surface of medical staff protective apparel and the floors in patient areas and are then resuspended by the movements of medical staff. The second batch of TSP samples taken in Fangcang MSAs all tested negative with reduced number of patients from > 200 to 100 per zone and implementation of more rigorous and thorough sanitization measures in Fangcang. The comparison of the two batches of samples showed the effectiveness and importance of sanitization in reducing the airborne SARS-CoV-2 in high risk areas.**<br/>

We call for particular attentions on 1) the proper use and cleaning of toilets (e.g. ventilation and sterilization), as a potential spread source of coronavirus with relatively high risk caused by aerosolization of virus and contamination of surfaces after use; 2) for the general public, the proper use of personal protection measures, such as wearing masks and avoiding busy crowds; 3) the effective sanitization of the high risk area and the use of high level protection masks for medical staff with direct contact with the COVID-19 patients or with long stay in high risk area; 4) the renovation of large stadiums as field hospitals with nature ventilation and protective measures is an effective approach to quarantine and treat mild symptom patients so as to reduce the COVID-19 transmission among the public; 5) the virus may be resuspended from the contaminated protective apparel surface to the air while taking off and from the floor surface with the movement of medical staff. Thus, surface sanitization of the apparel before they are taken off may also help reduce the infection risk for medical staff.

Thoroughly cleaning environmental surfaces with water and detergent and applying commonly used hospital-level disinfectants (such as sodium hypochlorite) are effective and sufficient procedures." [11] The typical use of bleach is at a dilution of 1:100 of 5% sodium hypochlorite resulting in a final concentration of 0.05% [12] . The recently published data with coronaviruses suggest that a concentration of 0.1% is effective in 1 min [7] . That is why it seems appropriate to recommend a dilution 1:50 of standard bleach in the coronavirus setting. For the disinfection of small surfaces ethanol (62%e71%; carrier tests) revealed a similar efficacy against coronavirus [7] . Ethanol at 70% ethanol is also recommended by the WHO for disinfecting small surfaces [12] .**<br/>

Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly have some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-toperson spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring. The 2019-nCoV is spreading from person to person in China and limited spread among close contacts has been detected in some countries outside China. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.

Not only purified RNA can be used as the sample input, but also direct tissue or cell lysate may be used without an RNA purification step. This combination of a quick sample preparation method with an easy detection process may allow the development of portable, field detection in addition to a rapid screening for point-of-need testing applications. This virus represents an emerging significant public health concern and expanding the scope of diagnostic utility to applications outside of traditional laboratories will enable greater prevention and surveillance approaches. The efforts made here will serve as a model for inevitable future outbreaks where the use of next generation portable diagnostics will dramatically expand the reach of our testing capabilities for better healthcare outcomes.**<br/>

The standardization can be achieved by, for example, ensuring that all the devices and systems are linked into a single network, like was done in the U.S., where all the surveillance of healthcare were combined into the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSH) [35] . The fact that cities are increasingly tuning on the concept of Smart Cities and boasting an increased adoption rate of technological and connected products, existing surveillance networks can be re-calibrated to make use of those new sets of databases.

As noted by the WHO [40] , the healthcare guidelines and regulatory practices are advanced to also ensure that the health risk in question is reduced together with its consequences. In the current era of technological advancement, such regulations and guidelines are paramount as they have potential to lead to positive or negative outcomes. The position of this paper is to advance that it now possible to integrate technologies like the use of smart devices through IoT networks and wearable devices, data from mobile apps and others to help users to share information with accredited and certified health professionals, and in this case, improve the outcomes for better cross disciplinary and more resilient protocols and policies.**<br/>

Match (0.5368): **To increase sensitivity, current nucleic acid detection methods generally involve a 38 target amplification step prior to the detection step. The conventional amplification method is 39 based on PCR, which requires a thermocycler for delicate temperature modulation. As an 40 alternative to the thermal cycling-based amplification, isothermal amplification methods are 41 available, which rely primarily on a strand-displacing polymerase or T7 RNA polymerase at a 42 constant temperature 7 . However, the complex composition of the isothermal amplification 43 mixtures often renders these approaches incompatible with detection methods and whole 44 diagnosis generally becomes a multi-step process [8] [9] [10] [11] . The diagnostic regimen with multi-step 45 procedures requires additional time, instruments, and reagents, as well as skilled personnel to 46 perform the diagnostic procedure. This aspect limits the broad applicability of nucleic acid 47 diagnostics, especially in situations where rapid and simple detection is required. 48 3 efficiently ligate two DNA probes using a target single-stranded RNA as a splint, enabling 54 the sequence-specific detection of RNA molecule 17, 18 .

Infection of primates produces a more mild disease than that observed in humans, although fever and pulmonary inflammation were noted [39, 40] . MERS-CoV is incapable of infecting rodent cells without engineering changes in critical residues of the receptor protein, DPP4 [41, 42] . However, MERS-CoV does infect non-human primates [43] . As such, MERS mouse models of disease required a great deal of time to develop and are limited in the types of manipulations that can be performed [41] . At this point, the infectious capability of the 2019-nCoV for different species and different cell types is unknown.

Match (0.4878): **The currently known viruses of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus may be as (poorly) representative for this particular species as the few individuals that we selected to represent H. sapiens in Fig. 1 . It is thus reasonable to assume that this biased knowledge of the natural diversity of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus limits our current understanding of fundamental aspects of the biology of this species and, as a consequence, our abilities to control zoonotic spillovers to humans. Future studies aimed at understanding the ecology of these viruses and advancing the accuracy and resolution of evolutionary analyses 41 would benefit greatly from adjusting our research and sampling strategies. This needs to include an expansion of our current research focus on human pathogens and their adaptation to specific hosts to other viruses in this species. To illustrate the great potential of species-wide studies, it may again be instructive to draw a parallel to H. sapiens, and specifically to the impressive advancements in personalized medicine in recent years. Results of extensive genetic analyses of large numbers of individuals representing diverse populations from all continents have been translated into clinical applications and greatly contribute to optimizing patient-specific diagnostics and therapy. They were instrumental in identifying reliable predictive markers for specific diseases as well as genomic sites that are under selection. It thus seems reasonable to expect that genome-based analyses with a comparable species coverage will be similarly insightful for coronaviruses. Also, additional diagnostic tools that target the entire species should be developed to complement existing tools optimized to detect individual pathogenic variants (a proactive approach). Technical solutions to this problem are already available; for example, in the context of multiplex PCR-based assays 42 . The costs for developing and applying (combined or separate) species-and virus-specific diagnostic tests in specific clinical and/or epidemiological settings may help to better appreciate the biological diversity and zoonotic potential of specific virus species and their members. Also, the further reduction of time required to identify the causative agents of novel virus infections will contribute to limiting the enormous social and economic consequences of large outbreaks. To advance such studies, innovative fundraising approaches may be required.**<br/>

Based on our small sample of patients with COVID-19, we note an intriguing age distribution, reminiscent of that of SARS, which warrants further epidemiological and serological studies. We also report early signs that the response is strengthening in China on the basis of a decrease in case detection time, and rapid management of travel-related infections that are identified internationally. This is an early report of a rapidly evolving situation and the parameters discussed here could change quickly. In the coming weeks, we will continue to monitor the epidemiology of this outbreak using data from news reports and official sources.**<br/>

Match (0.4573): **Our analysis underscores the reality that respiratory viruses are difficult to detect by travel 359 screening programs, particularly if a substantial fraction of infected people show mild or 360 indistinct symptoms, and if incubation periods are long. Quantitative estimates of screening 361 effectiveness will improve as more is learned about this recently-emerged virus, and will vary 362 with the precise design of screening programs. However, we present a robust qualitative finding: 363 in any situation where there is widespread epidemic transmission in source populations from 364 which travellers are drawn, travel screening programs can slow but not stop the importation of 365 infected cases. By decomposing the factors leading to success or failure of screening efforts, 366 our work supports decision-making about program design, and highlights key questions for 367 further research. We hope that these insights may help to mitigate the global impacts of nCoV 368 by guiding effective decision-making in both high-and low-resource countries, and may 369 contribute to prospective improvements in travel screening policy for future emerging infections. 370 371 .

Match (0.4531): **How far a virus will eventually spread at local, regional, national and international levels is of central concern during an epidemic outbreak due to the severe consequences large-scale epidemics have on human well-being [5] , the stability and coherence of social systems [11] , and the global economy [23] . A thorough understanding of the genetic characteristics of a virus is crucial to understand the way it is (or may be) transmitted (e.g. human-to-human transmissibility) in order to be able to anticipate the potential reach of an outbreak and develop effective countermeasures. The recent outbreak of a new type of coronavirus -2019-nCoV -provides plenty of examples of the way researchers seek to quickly approach the aforementioned problems of genetic decomposition of the virus [2, 8] and modelling of its transmission dynamics [15] .**<br/>

Match (0.6152): **For healthcare personnel, to minimize the chance of exposures to 2019-nCoV needs to follow the standard of contact and airborne precautions, personal protection including gloves, gowns, respiratory protection, eye protection, and hand hygiene. Some procedures performed on 2019-nCoV infected patients could generate infectious aerosols, e.g., nasopharyngeal specimen collection, sputum induction, and open suctioning of airways should be performed cautiously. If performed, these procedures should take place in an airborne infection isolation room, and personnel should use respiratory and eye protection, and hand hygiene [30] . In addition, management of environmental infection control including laundry, food service utensils, and medical waste should also be performed. Artificial Intelligence (AI), alternative selection to reducing infection for medical personnel, should be explored (Joint developed by Respiratory Research Institution of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University and RealMax Ltd Co), which will be benefit for remote guidance of practices.**<br/>

Match (0.6013): **In view of the potential threat in the ophthalmology practice, it may be prudent to revisit the strategies that successfully curbed the transmission of SARS in 2003 [10] . With particular relevance to the ophthalmic practice, it may be beneficial to triage patients according to produced surveillance case definitions [11] . In 2003, the WHO launched a case classification scheme which triaged patients into general, suspect and probable categories. Ophthalmology practices in Hongkong, a country badly hit by SARS, recommended the full PPE for all cases regardless of SARS status. For suspect and probable cases, appointments were recommended to be deferred unless in the event of an ophthalmic emergency. These patients were seen in an isolation ward. An emphasis on hand hygiene measures and stocking up of PPE such as N95 masks, gloves, gowns and googles should also be considered while the mode of transmission is being identified. Decontamination and sterilisation protocols of clinical rooms and equipment should also be improved on as coronaviruses have been found to survive in environments outside the body for a long time [12] . For instance, it is still not established if higher concentrations of dilute bleach (1:10), a chemical used to sterilise the Goldmann applanation tonometer, can be utilised to eliminate coronaviruses [13] . Other shared equipment like the B-scan probe and contact lenses for photocoagulation will also need strict sterilisation protocols. Finally, the reduction of non-urgent ophthalmic operations should also be considered as the risk of viral transmission may outweigh the surgical benefits. For emergency operations, full PPE can be considered to reduce the probability of healthcare transmission.**<br/>

Match (0.5967): **Personal protective measures for the dental professionals At present, there is no specific guideline for the protection of dental professionals from 2019-nCoV infection in the dental clinics and hospitals. Although no dental professional has been reported to acquire 2019-nCoV infection to the date the paper was drafted, the last experience with the SARS coronavirus has shown vast numbers of acquired infection of medical professionals in hospital settings 57 . Since airborne droplet transmission of infection is considered as the main route of spread, particularly in dental clinics and hospitals, barrier-protection equipment, including protective eyewear, masks, gloves, caps, face shields, and protective outwear, is strongly recommended for all healthcare givers in the clinic/hospital settings during the epidemic period of 2019-nCoV.**<br/>

Match (0.6220): **In addition to population mobility and human-to-human contact, environmental factors can impact droplet transmission and survival of viruses (e.g., influenza) but have not yet been examined for this novel pathogen. Absolute humidity, defined as the water content in ambient air, has been found to be a strong environmental determinant of other viral transmissions (4, 5) . For example, influenza viruses survive longer on surfaces or in droplets in cold and dry air -increasing the likelihood of subsequent transmission. Thus, it is key to understand the effects of environmental factors on the ongoing outbreak to support decision-making pertaining to disease control. Especially in locations where the risk of transmission may have been underestimated, such as in humid and warmer locations.**<br/>

Match (0.5431): **The outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan in December 2019 has led to a serious public 69 health event [1] [2] [3] . Meanwhile, the outbreak of this novel virus has placed 70 unprecedented challenges on hospital environmental hygiene. The occurrence of 71 medical staff-associated infections is closely related to long-lived pathogens in the 72 hospital environment [4, 5] . Thus, it is crucial to assess hospital environmental hygiene 73 to understand the most important environmental issues for controlling the spread of 74 COVID-19 in hospitals. The Chinese government quickly adopted quarantine 75 measures for confirmed and suspected patients to restrain the spread of the 76 pandemic [6] . Comprehensive monitoring of hospital environmental hygiene during the 77 outbreak of the pandemic is conducive to the refinement of hospital infection control 78 [5, 7] . It also increases understanding of the environmental challenges corresponding to 79 the reemergence of COVID-19 or similar viruses. Therefore, it is of great significance 80 to ensure the safety of medical treatment and the quality of hospital infection control 81 through the monitoring of environmental hygiene.

Match (0.5404): **A secondary propagation route Due to the versatility of the virus, in addition to interfering with the immune response, contagion may involve a variety of causes, such as environments contaminated with virus carrier secretions, dirty water effluents, besides the expected direct contamination via aerosols. This makes that the oro-fecal route should be considered as an important complement of contact with the virus (recent information sustains this hypothesis 11 ).This was observed at the Amoy Gardens cluster of cases for SARS 12, 13 . This observation prompted us to include in our model, besides the major respiratory route, a secondary propagation route, which is not a direct human-to-human propagation but rather some indirect vector (or environment element) to/from human. A second important consequence of assuming the presence of an indirect route is that the selection pressure on virus mutants will differ considerably between lung tropism and gut tropism. Finally, there may be a difference in incubation time, the -gut tropism‖ version of the virus would possibly cause less fever 14 . This hypothesis is consistent with some propagation patterns, e.g. the first case in Macau, which was not detected at the border, implying that that the affected person did not have fever. We should note that this makes the disease considerably more dangerous in terms of propagation because carriers are, at least for some time "invisible" and display a risky behavior 15, 16 .**<br/>

Match (0.4688): **One Health approaches attempt to strategize the coordinated efforts of multiple overlapping disciplines [19] , including environmental surveillance and environmental health. Primary components of the approach lie in animal health and environmental aspects. At the time of writing, the host from which the SARS-CoV-2 entered the human population is unknown although the suspicion is that food markets are likely sources for the original spillover. While the search for the natural host highly implicates bats [21] , search for the intermediary host, if any, is ongoing with the suggestions of the pangolin as a host far from certain. While it is premature to implicate any one particular urban source or natural host, the ensuing search will give insight into pathogens with potential to cross over into human transmission. This approach of environmental surveillance forms part of the PREDICT strategy [20] for detecting viruses with potential for spillover into human.**<br/>

Match (0.4683): **This mini-review evaluated the common epidemiological patterns of both SARS epidemics in China and identified cold, dry winter as a common environmental condition conducive for SARS virus infection to human beings. Thus, meteorological information should be integrated into future forecast of potential outbreak of new SARS. The identification of bats as very likely natural hosts for SARS-CoVs and consideration of some other wild animals as potential intermediate hosts leads to a prevention requirement of protecting natural ecosystem and prohibiting consumption of wildlife. The presentation of different scenarios of SARS outbreaks points to some urgency in identifying the true origin(s) of SARS-CoVs and establishing more comprehensive anti-infection measures that will resist any kind of viral assault.**<br/>

Match (0.4586): **SARS-CoV-2 has entered human communities, and eliminating virus from human bodies does not means its eradication in nature. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection will remain for a long time. Thus, adequate cautions must be taken for safe-guarding against future outbreaks of SARS. The prevention can be achieved by implementing a multi-facet system that considers both natural and social aspects of the SARS epidemiology discussed earlier. For example, regular surveillance of viral status in nature should be carried out to monitor the variation/evolution and abundance/localization of the virus. This information may be served as an early warning and used for preparation of potential vaccines. The government should issue laws and policies to tighten protection of wildlife and prohibit consumption of wild animals. A grass-roots and transparent reporting system should be established and put into public use for reporting any case of confirmed or suspected human infection. The disease-reporting system should be organically synchronized with the meteorological system so that adverse environmental conditions conducive for viral infection on human beings can be forecasted and macro-scale preparations can be made in case an emergency occurs. Finally, but not lastly, in developing human society including building massive constructions for residence and transportation, potential ecological impact on wildlife and possible consequences of breaking natural balance of the ecosystems should be carefully evaluated.**<br/>

Within the coming days or weeks it will become clear whether sustained local transmission has been occurring in other cities outside of Hubei province in China, or in other countries. If sustained transmission does occur in other locations, it would be valuable to determine whether there is variation in transmissibility by location, for example because of different behaviours or control measures, or because of different environmental conditions. To address the latter, virus survival studies can be done in the laboratory to confirm whether there are preferred ranges of temperature or humidity for 2019-nCoV transmission to occur.**<br/>
