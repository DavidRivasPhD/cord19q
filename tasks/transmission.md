# Range of incubation periods for the disease in humans (and how this varies across age and health status) and how long individuals are contagious, even after recovery.

#### Highlights<br/>
- A key area of uncertainty is whether, and for how long, individuals are infectious before symptom onset, and whether subclinical infection occurs; both are likely to make the outbreak harder to control. [Hellewell et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30074-7)<br/>
- 2,10,21,61-63 Immunocompromised patients can present with longer incubation periods of up to 20 days. [Memish et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(19)33221-0)<br/>
- We show that the impact of asymptomatic transmission depends on generation intervals (i.e., time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person). [Park et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033514)<br/>
- We assume Î½ = 1/7, which means that the average period of infectiousness of asymptomatic infectious individuals is 7 days. [Liu et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.20034314)<br/>
- The incubation period is the time from infection to the onset of the disease. [Han et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027474)<br/>

# Prevalence of asymptomatic shedding and transmission (e.g., particularly children).

#### Highlights<br/>
- Importantly, viral shedding can occur for days for weeks furtively in asymptomatic carrier individuals especially children and fecal shedding has been noted in patients without diarrhea. [Aslam et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healun.2020.03.007)<br/>
- Thus, we investigate the relationship between individual-level features of asymptomatic cases (e.g., the probability that an infection is asymptomatic, asymptomatic case duration, transmission by asymptomatic individuals) to dynamics at the population scale. [Park et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033514)<br/>
- It is reported that both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with 2019-nCov can play a role in disease transmission via airborne and contact. [Minjin Wang et al](https://doi.org/10.1093/pcmedi/pbaa002)<br/>
- As asymptomatic persons are potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection 24 . [Cui et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028225)<br/>
- Younger individuals are more likely to be asymptomatic and less infectious, i.e. [Source](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033050)<br/>

# Seasonality of transmission.

#### Highlights<br/>
- A seasonality factor of 0 indicates no seasonal variation in R0 for SARS-CoV-2. [Kissler et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031112)<br/>
- If 2019-nCoV, similar to influenza, has strong seasonality in its transmission, our epidemic forecast might not be reliable. [Wu et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30260-9)<br/>
- Seasonal viral respiratory pathogens prevalent in Taiwan [Hsih et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.008)<br/>
- Here we explore scenarios where temperate regions have a seasonal forcing of between Îµ = 0.3 and 0.7 and migration rates of 0.01/year. [Neher et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022806)<br/>
- The superposition of many such subpopulations with a range of R 0 values and seasonal variation in transmission will result in dynamics that are qualitatively different from a single population SIR model. [Neher et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022806)<br/>

# Natural history of the virus and shedding of it from an infected person

#### Highlights<br/>
- Prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stools of infected children indicates the potential for the virus to be transmitted through fecal excretion. [Xing et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.20033159)<br/>
- After an individual is exposed, the transmission of virus particles from one person to another will make an "exposed" person become "infected". [Hao et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028571)<br/>
- This means that the transmission route was mainly from person to person rather than from reservoir to person in the early stage of the transmission in Wuhan City. [Yin et al](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00640-3)<br/>
- 2019-nCoV is thought to be transmitted through droplets, close contact, aerosol and maybe fecal-oral transmission, and patients in the incubation period can transmit the virus to other persons . [Li et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2020.02.002)<br/>
- Transmission via the faecal-oral route remains a possibility as SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but not live virus, has been detected in stool . [Ling et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.accpm.2020.02.002)<br/>

# Disease models, including animal models for infection, disease and transmission

#### Highlights<br/>
- Secondly, animal models of SARS-CoV infection could not simulate human disease because of an incongruent pathogenesis. [Yang et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102434)<br/>
- As a result, non-human primates may be susceptible to 2019-nCoV and serve as animal models for antiviral research or intermediate hosts for cross-species transmission. [Li et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.013)<br/>
- To date, many problems remain to be solved, including the virus' origin, extent, and duration of transmission in humans, its ability to infect animal hosts, its spectrum and pathogenesis of human infections, and an effective vaccine development. [Li et al](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13238-020-00693-y)<br/>
- The dynamics of the disease is governed by an SEIR compartmental model. [Aleta et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029801)<br/>
- R , the number of removed individuals, is not included in the model as in the SIR/SEIR models. [Zhao et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028639)<br/>

# Immune response and immunity

- Immune deficiency or immune over-response may result in the condition of patients with COVID-19 becoming critical or severe. [Huang et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.15.20033472)<br/>
- Inflammasomes are molecular platforms activated upon cellular infection or stress that trigger the maturation of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1Î² to engage innate immune defenses . [Farag et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2020.105738)<br/>

# Role of the environment in transmission
#### Highlights<br/>
-    Although direct droplet transmission is an important route of transmission, faecal excretion, environmental contamination, and fomites might contribute to viral transmission. [Yeo et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-1253(20)30048-0)<br/>
- Those asymptomatic cases may play a role in the transmission and thus pose a significant infection control challenge. [Al-Tawfiq et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101608)<br/>
- 2 Data exist to support the notion that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are viable in environmental conditions that could facilitate faecal-oral transmission. [Yeo et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-1253(20)30048-0)<br/>
- The role of faecal-oral transmission is yet to be determined in COVID-19 but was found to occur during the SARS outbreak. [Heymann et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30374-3)<br/>
- It is believed that the primary transmission mode of COVID-19 is through large respiratory droplets and close contact, although there is limited data that indicates that it may also spread through indirect contact with contaminated environments and aerosols.
