- Depending on how much time has passed since exposure to the primary infected individual, those infected may not yet be symptomatic -this period of time between infection and symptoms is an important epidemiological trait of an infectious disease called the incubation period.<br/>
- Upon infection, individuals progress through a latent period before onset of infectiousness; during the duration of infectiousness, the relative infectiousness follows a triangular distribution.<br/>
- The longer serial interval in scenario 2 (mean = 7.5 days) resulted in slower disease dynamics: mean duration of infectiousness 4.8 days [95% CI 1.12, 10.5]; mean time of peak relative infectiousness at 38% of the duration of infectiousness [0%, 97%]; and a mean time of infectiousness onset 0.51 days after symptom onset [0.77 days before, 1.50 after] (Table 2, Figure S2 ).<br/>

- It is not clear when an individual becomes infectious; thus, we considered two scenarios: 1) the latent period is the same as the incubation period, and 2) the latent period is 2 days shorter than the incubation period, i.e.<br/>
- It has been shown that this estimation depends on the distributions of the latent period (defined as the period between the times when an individual infected and become infectious) and the infectious period (14) .<br/>

*Mar 06, 2020*<br/>
- A seasonality factor of 0 indicates no seasonal variation in R0 for SARS-CoV-2.<br/>
- A seasonality factor of 0.5 indicates that the amplitude of seasonal variation in R0 for SARS-CoV-2 is half the amplitude of the seasonal variation in R0 for the other betacoronaviruses.<br/>
- A seasonality factor of 1 indicates equal seasonal variation in R0 for SARS-CoV-2 as for the other human betacoronaviruses.<br/>
- A seasonality factor of 1 indicates equivalent seasonal variation in R0, while 0 indicates no seasonal variation (see Table S2 -3).<br/>
- The seasonality factor represents the amount of seasonal variation in the SARS-CoV-2 R0 relative to the other human betacoronaviruses.<br/>
- This choice was informed by observations on the seasonal variation in R0 for influenza, for which the wintertime R0 was similar between geographic locations with distinct climates, while the summertime R0 varied substantially between locations (11) .<br/>
- We assumed that the spline coefficients were constant across all seasons though seasonal forcing likely differed from year to year based on underlying drivers.<br/>
- According to a study of geographic variation in the SARS-CoV-2 basic reproduction number across China, seasonal variations in absolute humidity will be insufficient to prevent the widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (26) .<br/>
- We first assessed the role of seasonal variation, duration of immunity, and cross immunity on the transmissibility of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 in the US.<br/>
- https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031112 doi: medRxiv preprint infection due to SARS-CoV-2, and autumn establishments and smaller seasonal fluctuations in transmissibility were associated with larger pandemic peak sizes.<br/>
- However, we expect that if post-pandemic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 does take hold in temperate regions, there will also be continued transmission in tropical regions seeded by the seasonal outbreaks to the north and south.<br/>
- The strain-season coefficients were fairly consistent across seasons for each strain and lacked a clear correlation with incidence in prior seasons, consistent with experimental results showing substantial waning of immunity within a year (14) .<br/>
- We summarized the post-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 dynamics into the categories of annual outbreaks, biennial outbreaks, sporadic outbreaks, or virtual elimination.<br/>
- absolute humidity) of seasonal variation in coronavirus transmission have not been identified, we did not include them in our model but .<br/>

- Here we use data on seasonal variation in prevalence of seasonal CoVs in Sweden and model the impact of this variation on the possible future spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere.<br/>
- The seasonal CoVs show a strong and consistent seasonal variation, and modeling suggests that this requires strong variation in transmissibility throughout the year.<br/>
- A/H1N1pdm09 has subsequently transitioned into a seasonal pattern causing winter epidemics in temperate climates.<br/>
- With these assumptions, we can solve the model and compare the resulting trajectories to the seasonal variation in prevalence of seasonal CoVs, see Fig.<br/>
- The analysis of seasonal CoV prevalence patterns allowed us to constrain parameter ranges and explore different scenarios of SARS-CoV-2 spread around the globe, in particular in temperate climates like Northern Europe.<br/>
- As a result, many respiratory viruses show clear seasonal variation in prevalence; the most well-known example being seasonal influenza which peaks every winter in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere (Petrova and Russell, 2018) .<br/>
- We report on the possible influence of seasonal variation on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Northern Hemisphere, in a pandemic scenario.<br/>
- An R 0 ≈ 3 in winter in Hubei and a seasonal forcing of ε = 0.4 implies an annual average R 0 = β 0 /ν = 2.2.<br/>
- Here we explore scenarios where temperate regions have a seasonal forcing of between ε = 0.3 and 0.7 and migration rates of 0.01/year.<br/>
- These two scenarios differ slightly in the time of year at which peak transmissibility θ occurs: When transmission is mostly local and seasonality is amplified by .<br/>
-  Seasonal forcing ε was drawn from a uniform distribution between 0.25 and 0.75 for temperate regions, .<br/>

*Infectious Diseases of Poverty - 2020*<br/>
- We simulated the natural history of the infection that the proportion of asymptomatic infection was 50%, and the transmissibility of asymptomatic infection was half of that of symptomatic infection, which were different to those of MERS and SARS.<br/>
- We assumed that the virus transmitted among the bats, and then transmitted to unknown hosts (probably some wild animals).<br/>
- This means that the transmission route was mainly from person to person rather than from reservoir to person in the early stage of the transmission in Wuhan City.<br/>
- The value of R 0 was estimated of 2.30 from reservoir to person, and from person to person and 3.58 from person to person which means that the expected number of secondary infections that result from introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population was 3.58.<br/>

- 2019-nCoV is thought to be transmitted through droplets, close contact, aerosol and maybe fecal-oral transmission, and patients in the incubation period can transmit the virus to other persons.<br/>
- Therefore, besides respiratory and bodily contact, fecal-oral transmission is a potential route for 2019-nCoV infection.<br/>
- Indeed, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats, the natural reservoir, but transmitted to humans via intermediate host civets and camels, respectively.<br/>

*One Health - Mar 16, 2020*<br/>
- In the light of the One Health concept, control of this emerging virus requires the reduction of the viral shedding to the environment from the main reservoirs, for animal-person transmission and from humans for person-person transmission.<br/>
- Therefore, it reduces the possibility of virus shedding from the infected patients to its close contacts.<br/>

- Recently, new coronavirus was detected in the feces of confirmed patients in Wuhan, Shenzhen and even the first case in the United States, indicating that the virus can replicate in the digestive tract and exist, suggesting the possibility of fecal-oral transmission, but it is not certain that eating virus-contaminated food causes infection and transmission.<br/>
- Health officials have identified evidence of transmission along a chain of 4 "generations" (a person who originally contracted the virus from a nonhuman source infected someone else, who infected another individual, who then infected another individual), suggesting sustained human-to-human transmission.<br/>

*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- In this context, considerable efforts have been made from Regulatory Authorities and professional associations to improve the quality in the pharmaceutical processes to minimize the risk for the patients and improve the effectiveness of the manufacturing processes (ISPE, 2014; PDA, 2014; EMA, 2019c; Various Associations, 2019b) .<br/>
- The application of a modern pharmaceutical quality system promotes a systematic and continuous evaluation, understanding and refining of the formulation and the manufacturing process by the identification of the critical material attributes and process parameters and by the determination of the existing functional relationship between such factors and the responses (i.e.<br/>
- To mitigate the risk of quality-failures, the EMA promoted the application of the quality-by-design and quality risk assessment principles to the manufacturing of medicinal products (EMA, 2015a (EMA, ,b, 2017 .<br/>
- Economic incentives to MAHs producing medicinal products can be provided as cut-off of the regulatory costs/times to implement the quality in their manufacturing process and to improve their resilience to production blockage.<br/>
- However, for low-and medium-impact products, the development of protocols to rationalize the clinical medicine substitution or to activate importation procedures may be more effective.<br/>
- For these considerations, the adoption of the preventing tools proposed by the stakeholders' associations (PDA, 2014; ISPE, 2014) could be carried out gradually by the MAHs based on both the shortage impact of a product on the treated patients and the economic sustainability for the MAHs production.<br/>

*Health Policy and Technology - Mar 31, 2020*<br/>
- Developments in diagnostics are likely to include more advanced imaging, increasing availability of point of care testing (biochemical and genomic), and the further extension of genomics into clinical practice, potentially before and around the time of birth.<br/>
- Trade and tariff barriers arising from evolving isolationist policies of the USA are also likely to restrict progress on implementation and the health impact of achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, not least through increased international costs of diagnostics, devices and medicines.<br/>
- Expected further and new therapeutic approaches -many with ethical challenges -include biosimilars, more precision medicines with companion diagnostics, regenerative medicine, gene editing, more advanced microsurgery and robotics, therapeutic radiology and new devices for managing diabetes mellitus, pain control, heart disease and many other conditions.<br/>

*The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology - Apr 30, 2020*<br/>
- The viability of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV under various conditions and their prolonged presence in the environment suggest the potential for coronaviruses to be transmitted via contact or fomites.<br/>
- 2 Data exist to support the notion that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are viable in environmental conditions that could facilitate faecal-oral transmission.<br/>
- Although direct droplet transmission is an important route of transmission, faecal excretion, environmental contamination, and fomites might contribute to viral transmission.<br/>
- Future research on the possibility of faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should include environmental studies to determine whether the virus remains viable in conditions that would favour such transmission.<br/>
