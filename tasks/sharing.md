*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- Single National points of contact (SPOC) have been created to facilitate sharing of the information about nationwide medicine shortages and the coordination of emergency plans among the competent National Authorities and the EMA.<br/>
- Considering such critical issues and the latest position papers of stakeholder associations (Various Associations, 2019a,b), the establishment of harmonized metrics to classify the impact of medicine shortage on the National Healthcare Systems is a mandatory step to enhance the cooperation among competent National Authorities of the European countries and to rationalize the efforts to mitigate them.<br/>
- For multi-country shortages, the EMA's scientific committees should also be involved to write harmonized recommendations to healthcare professionals.<br/>
- Moreover, the shortage-impact scores can be used as a basis for harmonizing the graphical formats of the communication campaigns in all the EU countries.<br/>
- For example, the cooperation process among the concerned National Authorities is not detailed, since no systematic procedure on the information sharing among National SPOC has been provided yet (EMA and HMA, 2019a,b) .<br/>

# Understanding and mitigating barriers to information-sharing.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Restoring public confidence in public health measures in imperative otherwise public fear and apprehension might hinder the local, national, regional and international efforts and measures to tackling global health emergency issues such as the Covid-19 outbreak.<br/>
- In the meantime, basic knowledge of how high and low levels of health anxiety will impact behaviour as it relates to strategies for containing and mitigating viral spread is important for all decision-makers, health authorities, and health care professional and needs to be communicated to the public in an effort to curb maladaptive or irresponsible decisions that may negatively impact these efforts.<br/>
- Tracking heroisation and blame dynamics in realtime, as epidemics unfold, can help health authorities to understand public attitudes both to the threats posed by epidemics and the hope offered by health interventions, to fine-tune targeted health communication strategies accordingly, to identify and amplify local and international heroes, to identify and counter attempts to blame, scapegoat, and spread misinformation, and to improve crisis management practices for the future.<br/>
- We hope that these insights may help to mitigate the global impacts of COVID-19 by guiding effective decision-making in both high-and low-resource countries, and may contribute to prospective improvements in screening policy for future emerging infections.<br/>
- We hope that these insights may help to mitigate the global impacts of nCoV 368 by guiding effective decision-making in both high-and low-resource countries, and may 369 contribute to prospective improvements in travel screening policy for future emerging infections.<br/>

- Closer collaboration between local animal and human health authorities within the current epidemic disease prevention programmes will provide educational and training opportunities to promote risk-mitigation knowledge, skills and best practice in local communities.<br/>
- 14 However, detailed knowledge of the social and ecological mechanisms of zoonotic disease emergence in the region is limited, and therefore cannot yet inform evidence-based policies and practices for targeted surveillance programmes.<br/>
- 28 At the individual level, both risk and protective factors were analysed in terms of the individuals' knowledge, attitudes and practices to better understand the risk factors for identifying context-based strategies.<br/>
- 9,10 Further research to identify the risk factors among different populations will help develop more locally-relevant and fine-tuned risk mitigation strategies and address the social and ecological bias to identifying recommendations for other community settings.<br/>
- 15 Using a qualitative approach through ethnographic interviews and field observations, this study aimed to understand interactions among humans, animals and ecosystems, to shed light on the zoonotic risks in these presumed high-risk communities and to develop an evidence base for identifying appropriate strategies for zoonotic risk mitigation.<br/>

- In contrast, this paper seeks to inform the ongoing movements promoting interdisciplinarity as key to addressing global health challenges.<br/>
- By analysing data pertaining to researchers' and policy professionals' participation in policy networks one can test assumptions around interdisciplinarity and identify powerful knowledge gatekeepers.<br/>
- Debates around issues, such as the level to which communities could reduce transmission rates themselves, did not prevent this group from providing a coherent response to the key policy dilemmas.<br/>
- Global health governance is increasingly focused on epidemic and pandemic health emergencies that require an interdisciplinary approach to accessing scientific knowledge to guide preparedness and crisis response.<br/>

- For mitigating shortages that affect the Union, the stronger coordination at EU-level and the harmonization of communication, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies are desirable and urgent.<br/>
- Consequently, in the estimation of the shortage impact on the patient needs, this aspect should be primary for harmonizing the existing metrics and rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted.<br/>
- This manuscript aims to review the current upgrade of the European regulatory framework on medicine shortages and to propose a theoretical approach for 1) determining the shortage/unavailability impact on the capability of the National Healthcare Systems and 2) rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted in function of the leading cause of shortage (e.g., production, price and importation/exportation).<br/>

- Another key factor in successfully preventing and managing emerging threats is the rapid and transparent sharing of information between countries and agencies.<br/>
- This is always a challenging process when balancing the resources focussed on analysing the situation on the ground with resources directed at interpreting the information for journalists but in SARS, the R 0 was seen to decrease in response to information reaching the public and the public then adopting risk reduction actions ; so accurate public risk communication is critical to success.<br/>

# Integration of federal/state/local public health surveillance systems.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Big data and artificial intelligence systems are tools that can be used to fully integrate the information, conduct comprehensive research and analyze public health risks.<br/>
- Whilst strong epidemiology and surveillance systems are indispensable tools for the detection and monitoring of outbreaks and public health emergencies, strong primary care systems form the foundation of any emergency response.<br/>
- Notably, DXY.cn does not generate data outside of traditional surveillance systems but rather provides a channel of rapid communication between the public and health authorities.<br/>
- Since SARS in 2003, China has implemented legislation on the surveillance, reporting and early warning system of infectious diseases, requiring the regular release of information during public health emergencies.<br/>
- But trust is a crucial support to public health systems.<br/>

by Asmundson, Gordon J.G.; Taylor, Steven<br/>
*Journal of Anxiety Disorders - Apr 30, 2020*<br/>
- Accordingly, it is critical that public health decision-makers, health authorities, and health care providers across disciplines understand how health anxiety will influence responses to viral outbreaks, including current responses to COVID-19.<br/>
- Psychological factors are known to play a vital role in the success of public health strategies used to manage epidemics and pandemics; that is, risk communication, vaccination and antiviral therapy, hygiene practices, and social distancing.<br/>

# Risk communication and guidelines that are easy to understand and follow (include targeting at risk populations’ families too).

#### Highlights<br/>
- Good risk communication allows people to know from trusted sources in real-time the risks they may face, and any protective measures they can take to help minimise this.<br/>
- It is easy to understand that this can be perceived as withholding information and why the public would be frustrated.<br/>
- Such analysis can inform predictions about potential future growth , help estimate risk to other countries , and guide the design of alternative interventions .<br/>
- 4, 5 Such analysis can inform predictions about potential future growth, 6 help estimate risk to other countries, 7 and guide the design of alternative interventions.<br/>
- Information is required that will help refine the risk assessment as the outbreak continues and ensure that patients are managed in the best possible way.<br/>

# Communication that indicates potential risk of disease to all population groups.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Given the ubiquity of comorbidities in the elderly population, and their increased susceptibility to severe COVID-19 infection , knowledge on the differing prevalence and risk of various conditions may help to focus and tailor public health efforts such as the screening of asymptomatic individuals, risk communication, contact tracing, self-isolation and social distancing.<br/>
- Estimation of the Transmission Risk of the 2019-nCoV and Its Implication for Public Health Interventions<br/>
- Health education on knowledge for disease prevention and control is also important.<br/>
- Additional information about 2019-nCoV is needed to better understand transmission, disease severity, and risk to the general population.<br/>
- Although risk of contracting the disease in the United States (US) is currently low , it is important to understand risk perceptions about COVID-19 and trust in political and public health/scientific leadership among the US population to better inform messaging and policies .<br/>

- For these measures to be effective, a special attention should be devoted to those population groups that are more at risk and to the strength of the connections across generations.<br/>
- While population age structure is crucial for understanding the populations at the highest risk of mortality both across and within countries, it is also vital for understanding how much social distancing measures are required in each population to reduce the number of most critical cases and overload on the health system-aka "flattening the curve" .<br/>
- The population structure of contact can be represented as age-homogeneous communities that have low contact between groups.<br/>
- For these measures to be effective, special attention should be devoted to those population groups that are more at risk and patterns of intergenerational contact.<br/>

# Misunderstanding around containment and mitigation.

#### Highlights<br/>
-  Because of the extent of community spread, traditional public health measures might not be able to halt all human-to-human transmission, and we need to consider moving from containment to mitigation.<br/>
- For many countries around the world, the focus of public health officers on the COVID-19 epidemic has shifted 238 from containment to mitigation and delay.<br/>
- Information on the transmission characteristics will help coordinate current screening and containment strategies, support decision making on whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), and is key for anticipating the risk of pandemic spread of 2019-nCoV.<br/>
- Information on the transmission characteristics will help coordinate current screening and containment strategies, support decision making on whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), and is necessary for anticipating the risk of pandemic spread of 2019-nCoV.<br/>
- Understanding the transmission characteristics of 2019-nCoV and the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission is critically important for coordinating current screening and containment strategies, and for determining whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.<br/>

*Epidemiol Infect.; 148:e22 - 2020*<br/>
- This is always a challenging process when balancing the resources focussed on analysing the situation on the ground with resources directed at interpreting the information for journalists but in SARS, the R 0 was seen to decrease in response to information reaching the public and the public then adopting risk reduction actions ; so accurate public risk communication is critical to success.<br/>
- Working with journalists and the media to help them understand the science and epidemiology, particularly in a fast moving event, will improve risk communication to the public and reduce inappropriate concerns and panic.<br/>

*Mar 13, 2020*<br/>
- In the absence of effective treatments and vaccines, an early adoption of stringent public health measures is crucial in mitigating the scale and burden of an outbreak.<br/>
- How differentiation and combination of these interventions within a coherent and systematic package of public health measures contributes to different outbreak outcomes is an urgent global health issue that must be addressed in order to ensure that lessons from countries that have early experienced COVID-19 outbreak can be learnt by other countries in their preparedness and management of a likely pandemic.<br/>

#### Highlights<br/>
- 27, 28 National public health capabilities and infrastructures remain at the core of global health security, because they are the first line of defence in infectious disease emergencies.<br/>
- The application of such a vast technical and operational set of interventions depends on countries' public health and laboratory infrastructures and resources.<br/>
- Effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources.<br/>
- 1 The application of such a vast technical and operational set of interventions depends on each country's public health and laboratory infrastructures and resources.<br/>

by Galaxy and HyPhy developments teams,  ; Nekrutenko, A.; Kosakovsky Pond, S. L.<br/>
*Feb 25, 2020*<br/>
- This impedes global research cooperation, which is essential for tackling public health emergencies, and requires unimpeded access to data, analysis tools, and computational infrastructure.<br/>
- Here we show that community efforts in developing open analytical software tools over the past ten years, combined with national investments into scientific computational infrastructure, can overcome these deficiencies and provide an accessible platform for tackling global health emergencies in an open and transparent manner.<br/>
- The goal of our study was to raise awareness of the lack of primary data necessary to effectively respond to global emergencies such as the COVID-19 outbreak and demonstrate that all analyses can be performed transparently with already existing open source publicly available tools and computational infrastructure.<br/>
- Specifically, we use all COVID-19 genomic data available in the public domain so far to underscore the importance of access to raw data and to demonstrate that existing community efforts in curation and deployment of biomedical software can reliably support rapid, reproducible research during global health crises.<br/>

by Musazzi, Umberto M.; Di Giorgio, Domenico; Minghetti, Paola<br/>
*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- In particular, it has been highlighted the need to find collaborative solutions for medicine shortages to coordinate EU and National policies and communication campaigns.<br/>
- For these products, more centralized coordination of the risk control strategies by the EMA and, consequently, a more efficient sharing of information among National Regulatory Authorities are needed to better mitigation of shortage impact at a national level and to fulfil the needs of all the patients.<br/>
- Here again, the establishing a unique decision tree to support National decision about medicine importation/exportation could be useful to reduce the fragmentation of shortage-mitigating strategies among European countries and to improve the effectiveness of the National strategic plan to satisfy the patients' needs, without altering the National regulatory framework.<br/>

# Measures to reach marginalized and disadvantaged populations.

#### Highlights<br/>
- The need for healthcare resources may be higher in some US cities where there is a higher prevalence of vulnerable populations (age and comorbidity) than in Wuhan.<br/>
- In conclusion, we suggest that in a scenario where containment is not possible and it is necessary to allow some infections to occur to achieve population immunity, interventions that protect vulnerable populations from getting infected should be given the highest priority, followed by interventions targeting the general population, and finally those targeting the least vulnerable, which for COVID-19 seem to be children.<br/>
- Homeless populations might be more transient and geographically mobile than individuals in the general population, 8 making it difficult to track and prevent transmission and to treat those who need care.<br/>
- Most of these cities have large populations and international airports, highly connected with other regions within and beyond China.<br/>
- 2 Despite the powerful community coping strategy of African migrants in China, their social and structural barriers to health care should be taken into consideration in implementing Africa-China health cooperation plans, 1 particularly during the current outbreak of COVID-19.<br/>

*Mar 17, 2020*<br/>
- While school closures have proven to be an important means for delaying or reducing outbreaks , they come with large economic and societal costs, with generally an outsized impact on disadvantaged and vulnerable populations .<br/>
- In conclusion, we suggest that in a scenario where containment is not possible and it is necessary to allow some infections to occur to achieve population immunity, interventions that protect vulnerable populations from getting infected should be given the highest priority, followed by interventions targeting the general population, and finally those targeting the least vulnerable, which for COVID-19 seem to be children.<br/>
- Mitigation should then focus on allowing 'controlled spread' toward herd immunity in such a way that the most vulnerable populations are protected most.<br/>
- For COVID-19, this suggests that if the goal is to reduce overall mortality, we should implement interventions that preferentially protect elderly, while allowing the minimum number of infections required to reach population immunity to occur in the least vulnerable groups.<br/>

-    In the short term, travel restrictions prevent supplies from getting into affected areas, slow down the international public health response, stigmatise entire populations, and disproportionately harm the most vulnerable among us.<br/>
- This will exacerbate inequities, with those who have more financial and social capital having more options.<br/>

*Healthcare - 2020*<br/>
- Therefore, geopolitical issues are expected on the technological front as most large data-rich corporations are located in powerful countries that have influence both economically, health-wise and politically   .<br/>
- On the health sector, the same approach is being upheld where critical information and data are not freely shared between economies as that would be seen to be benefiting other in-competition economies, whereas different economies would cherish the maximization of benefits from such data collections.<br/>

*The Lancet Psychiatry - Feb 19, 2020*<br/>
- Compared with other international migrants (ie, international students), IMWs encounter more barriers in accessing health services in host countries (eg, inadequate health insurance), particularly migrant domestic workers.<br/>
- In addition, more countries should ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families to provide global health equity and ensure that migrant workers' health is not neglected in future epidemics and disasters.<br/>

by Tsai, Jack; Wilson, Michal<br/>
*The Lancet Public Health - Mar 11, 2020*<br/>
- Homeless populations might be more transient and geographically mobile than individuals in the general population, 8 making it difficult to track and prevent transmission and to treat those who need care.<br/>
- Cities with large homeless populations might face unique challenges while trying to contain COVID-19 and addressing homelessness, with the potential for both issues to exacerbate one another.<br/>

*Mar 08, 2020*<br/>
- This may be that the city is densely populated and has a large flow of people, and the epidemic situation in urban is more serious.<br/>
- In addition, this study also found that participants in the communities or administrative villages with isolators were more likely to using emotional-focused coping than those in the communities or administrative villages where was not affected or with diagnosed patients.<br/>

*Mar 16, 2020*<br/>
- In provinces distant from Wuhan, the central hub of the outbreak, inhabitants and local governments may have been less cautious (with few public and personal prevention measures) considering high costs of interventions and perceived low risk.<br/>
- This is expected considering intense economic connectivity: transportation links, for goods and people including enormous numbers of migrant workers working in those two cities.<br/>

# Data systems and research priorities and agendas incorporate attention to the needs and circumstances of disadvantaged populations and underrepresented minorities.

#### Highlights<br/>
- These countries may also suffer from poverty, political instability, terrorism, other endemic or epidemic infectious diseases competing for limited public health resources, low levels of literacy, and a lack of diagnostic or research laboratories.<br/>
- It integrates metrics from multiple areas, including demography, health care, public health, political and economic .<br/>
- 5 Regardless of IMWs communities' self-reliance and resilience, addressing their health needs should be made an urgent public health priority because infection among these individuals could also lead to community infection, eventually affecting the entire population's health.<br/>
- In the ongoing epidemic of COVID-19, all these aspects have not yet been fully addressed, although the global public health community is obliged to continually confront the epidemic and make political decisions encompassing travel restrictions, containment measures, and mitigation strategies.<br/>
- WHO's global COVID-19 strategic preparedness and response plan 13 therefore prioritises countries with weak health systems for technical and operational support from international partners.<br/>

*Social Science & Medicine - Apr 30, 2020*<br/>
- Only by seeking to understand the politics of knowledge and the social and political dynamics of global health and humanitarian networks can we challenge injustice and historically reinforced narratives that favour some perspectives over others.<br/>
- Haas helped define epistemic communities and how they differ from other policy communities, such as interest groups and advocacy coalitions (Haas, 1992) .<br/>
- This community did indeed emerge or coalesce around the demand placed on their expertise by policy makers concerned with the community engagement dimensions of the response.<br/>
- Global health governance is increasingly focused on epidemic and pandemic health emergencies that require an interdisciplinary approach to accessing scientific knowledge to guide preparedness and crisis response.<br/>
- In this area, clinicians, humanitarians and policy actors seemed to maintain a policy position directly opposed to anthropological based advice.<br/>
- They have an authoritative claim to policy relevant expertise in a particular domain and Haas claims that policy actors will routinely place them above other interest groups in their level of expertise.<br/>
- Ideas and knowledge do not simply flow within the network, given that dominant paradigms and political, social and cultural norms privilege better established knowledge communities (Tchilingirian, 2018) .<br/>

[New regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in Europe](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171)<br/>
by Musazzi, Umberto M.; Di Giorgio, Domenico; Minghetti, Paola<br/>
*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- Moreover, they also underlined the importance of improving the monitoring of shortages and cooperation in the EU by the establishment of a priority ranking of shortages to address "high-risk" medicinal products efficiently without introducing disproportionate initiatives that could have opposite effects to the ones intended.<br/>
- It is not feasible to introduce economic incentives for all medicinal products since it can affect the budgets of the Regulatory Authorities or, more in general, those of the National Healthcare Systems.<br/>
- Considering such critical issues and the latest position papers of stakeholder associations (Various Associations, 2019a,b), the establishment of harmonized metrics to classify the impact of medicine shortage on the National Healthcare Systems is a mandatory step to enhance the cooperation among competent National Authorities of the European countries and to rationalize the efforts to mitigate them.<br/>
- Such strategies cannot be applied to solve all shortage types, and the communications/cooperation among stakeholders may be limited.<br/>
- Indeed, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies adopted by professionals (e.g., pharmacists) and other stakeholders can be rationalized and harmonized based on the medicines shortage impact scores calculated by a competent National Authority.<br/>
- Consequently, in the estimation of the shortage impact on the patient needs, this aspect should be primary for harmonizing the existing metrics and rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted.<br/>

*The Lancet - Mar 02, 2020*<br/>
- Nonetheless, the health sector has much more to do and WHO has identified priorities for improving the collective health response.<br/>
- 15 Humanitarian agencies have adopted various approaches to address these constraints, including investments in local partners, cross-border operations, deconfliction, remote programming, and scaled up advocacy and humanitarian diplomacy.<br/>
- Effective humanitarian response is constrained by insecurity, disrupted health systems, limited local capacities, bureaucratic impediments, insufficient partners with strong operational presence, and underfunding.<br/>
- This new way of working leverages the comparative advantages of both humanitarian and development sectors.<br/>
- WHO's global COVID-19 strategic preparedness and response plan 13 therefore prioritises countries with weak health systems for technical and operational support from international partners.<br/>

*Healthcare - 2020*<br/>
- Therefore, geopolitical issues are expected on the technological front as most large data-rich corporations are located in powerful countries that have influence both economically, health-wise and politically   .<br/>
- Therefore, it becomes paramount to ensure that the measures taken to contain a virus transcend nationalist agendas where data and information sharing is normally restricted, to a more global agenda where humanity and global order are encouraged.<br/>
- With such an approach, it would be easier to share urban health data across geographies to better monitor emerging health threats in order to provide more economic stability, thereby ensuring no disruptions on such sectors like tourism and travel industries, amongst others.<br/>

# Mitigating threats to incarcerated people from COVID-19, assuring access to information, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

#### Highlights<br/>
- In the absence of effective treatments and vaccines, an early adoption of stringent public health measures is crucial in mitigating the scale and burden of an outbreak.<br/>
- Reliable, timely laboratory diagnosis and an effective vaccine are crucial for effective disease management and public health intervention.<br/>
- Its mission is to serve global health by the immediate dissemination of information, which may lead to new preventive measures, prevent the spread of outbreaks, and provide more accurate disease control.<br/>
- Learning from the effective measures used and problems encountered in the prevention and control of this epidemic, the government is likely to set up an emergency decision-making organization when responding to future public health emergencies.<br/>
- In the absence of cures and immunization for an emerging infectious disease like COVID-19, transportation control, an old-fashioned approach, is proven an effective public health intervention.<br/>

# Understanding coverage policies (barriers and opportunities) related to testing, treatment, and care
#### Highlights<br/>
- 31 Existing local preliminary programmes and policies around human and animal health, community development and conservation are considered effective resources to begin or continue developing cost-effective strategies to mitigate zoonotic risks.<br/>
- No study has focused on the practical implications of public health interventions and measures.<br/>
- However, despite these significant improved data, many questions about the new coronavirus remain, and answers could be strategic for programming and designing public health interventions.<br/>
- Effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources.<br/>
- Furthermore, compared with other public health interventions, health protection interventions are highly cost-effective.<br/>

- Consequently, in the estimation of the shortage impact on the patient needs, this aspect should be primary for harmonizing the existing metrics and rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted.<br/>
- In this way, the resulting metrics allow promoting, on the one hand, the harmonization of the risk assessment of the shortages at EU level and, on the other hand, the rationalization of the preventing management strategies in a cause-specific matter.<br/>
- For mitigating shortages that affect the Union, the stronger coordination at EU-level and the harmonization of communication, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies are desirable and urgent.<br/>
- This manuscript aims to review the current upgrade of the European regulatory framework on medicine shortages and to propose a theoretical approach for 1) determining the shortage/unavailability impact on the capability of the National Healthcare Systems and 2) rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted in function of the leading cause of shortage (e.g., production, price and importation/exportation).<br/>
