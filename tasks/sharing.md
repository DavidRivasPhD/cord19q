*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- For multi-country shortages, the EMA's scientific committees should also be involved to write harmonized recommendations to healthcare professionals.<br/>
- Single National points of contact (SPOC) have been created to facilitate sharing of the information about nationwide medicine shortages and the coordination of emergency plans among the competent National Authorities and the EMA.<br/>
- Moreover, the shortage-impact scores can be used as a basis for harmonizing the graphical formats of the communication campaigns in all the EU countries.<br/>
- Considering such critical issues and the latest position papers of stakeholder associations (Various Associations, 2019a,b), the establishment of harmonized metrics to classify the impact of medicine shortage on the National Healthcare Systems is a mandatory step to enhance the cooperation among competent National Authorities of the European countries and to rationalize the efforts to mitigate them.<br/>

# Understanding and mitigating barriers to information-sharing.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Tracking heroisation and blame dynamics in realtime, as epidemics unfold, can help health authorities to understand public attitudes both to the threats posed by epidemics and the hope offered by health interventions, to fine-tune targeted health communication strategies accordingly, to identify and amplify local and international heroes, to identify and counter attempts to blame, scapegoat, and spread misinformation, and to improve crisis management practices for the future.<br/>
- We hope that these insights may help to mitigate the global impacts of COVID-19 by guiding effective decision-making in both high-and low-resource countries, and may contribute to prospective improvements in screening policy for future emerging infections.<br/>
- We hope that these insights may help to mitigate the global impacts of nCoV 368 by guiding effective decision-making in both high-and low-resource countries, and may 369 contribute to prospective improvements in travel screening policy for future emerging infections.<br/>
- Given the current epidemic and limited understanding of the epidemiology of this disease, our findings on travel patterns from historical data can help contribute to tailoring public health interventions.<br/>
- Restoring public confidence in public health measures in imperative otherwise public fear and apprehension might hinder the local, national, regional and international efforts and measures to tackling global health emergency issues such as the Covid-19 outbreak.<br/>

*Int Health - Feb 10, 2020*<br/>
- 14 However, detailed knowledge of the social and ecological mechanisms of zoonotic disease emergence in the region is limited, and therefore cannot yet inform evidence-based policies and practices for targeted surveillance programmes.<br/>
- 28 At the individual level, both risk and protective factors were analysed in terms of the individuals' knowledge, attitudes and practices to better understand the risk factors for identifying context-based strategies.<br/>
- 9,10 Further research to identify the risk factors among different populations will help develop more locally-relevant and fine-tuned risk mitigation strategies and address the social and ecological bias to identifying recommendations for other community settings.<br/>
- Closer collaboration between local animal and human health authorities within the current epidemic disease prevention programmes will provide educational and training opportunities to promote risk-mitigation knowledge, skills and best practice in local communities.<br/>
- 15 Using a qualitative approach through ethnographic interviews and field observations, this study aimed to understand interactions among humans, animals and ecosystems, to shed light on the zoonotic risks in these presumed high-risk communities and to develop an evidence base for identifying appropriate strategies for zoonotic risk mitigation.<br/>

*Social Science & Medicine - Apr 30, 2020*<br/>
- In contrast, this paper seeks to inform the ongoing movements promoting interdisciplinarity as key to addressing global health challenges.<br/>
- Network theory provides a useful framework with which to explore the politics of knowledge in global health with its emphasis on individuals' social context.<br/>
- Debates around issues, such as the level to which communities could reduce transmission rates themselves, did not prevent this group from providing a coherent response to the key policy dilemmas.<br/>
- Global health governance is increasingly focused on epidemic and pandemic health emergencies that require an interdisciplinary approach to accessing scientific knowledge to guide preparedness and crisis response.<br/>
- By analysing data pertaining to researchers' and policy professionals' participation in policy networks one can test assumptions around interdisciplinarity and identify powerful knowledge gatekeepers.<br/>

*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- For mitigating shortages that affect the Union, the stronger coordination at EU-level and the harmonization of communication, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies are desirable and urgent.<br/>
- In this way, the resulting metrics allow promoting, on the one hand, the harmonization of the risk assessment of the shortages at EU level and, on the other hand, the rationalization of the preventing management strategies in a cause-specific matter.<br/>
- Consequently, in the estimation of the shortage impact on the patient needs, this aspect should be primary for harmonizing the existing metrics and rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted.<br/>

*Infect Dis Model - Feb 11, 2020*<br/>
- In order to respond swiftly and properly to the outbreak, public health decision-and policy-makers need timely and accurate epidemiological information, concerning, for example, how long it may take from exposure to the virus to illness/symptoms onset or which individuals, with specific characteristics or co-morbidities, are at higher risk of a poor prognosis.<br/>
- As recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO), mathematical models, especially those devised in a timely fashion, can play a key role in providing health decision-and policy-makers with evidence-based information.<br/>

# Communication that indicates potential risk of disease to all population groups.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Age and sex distributions are important in understanding risk of infection across populations.<br/>
- Owing to different impacts of the 57 disease across the population according to age, we consider the following age groups: 0-9, Table 1 .<br/>
- Additionally, the infection severity, including the infection-fatality rate across different ages and risk groups, must be established.<br/>
- It might be related to 248 the different contact characteristics among different age groups.<br/>
- Age and sex distributions can reflect heterogeneities in the risk of infection within affected populations.<br/>

- Thus, the exact implications of school closure in redistributing the risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among community members of different age groups remain uncertain.<br/>
- If an intervention mainly protects specific groups in a population, infections required to achieve population immunity will happen disproportionately in the other groups.<br/>
- As we discussed here, an additional consideration for COVID-19 is the fact that school closures might preferentially reduce infections in low risk groups , thus possibly shifting the burden of new infections that occur on the way to population immunity towards higher risk groups.<br/>

- For many countries around the world, the focus of public health officers on the COVID-19 epidemic has shifted 238 from containment to mitigation and delay.<br/>
-  Because of the extent of community spread, traditional public health measures might not be able to halt all human-to-human transmission, and we need to consider moving from containment to mitigation.<br/>
- Countries have to face the reality that individualcase containment might not be possible in the long run, and there might be the need to move from containment to mitigation, balancing the costs and benefits of public health measures.<br/>
- Information on the transmission characteristics will help coordinate current screening and containment strategies, support decision making on whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), and is key for anticipating the risk of pandemic spread of 2019-nCoV.<br/>

- The goal of our study was to raise awareness of the lack of primary data necessary to effectively respond to global emergencies such as the COVID-19 outbreak and demonstrate that all analyses can be performed transparently with already existing open source publicly available tools and computational infrastructure.<br/>
- Specifically, we use all COVID-19 genomic data available in the public domain so far to underscore the importance of access to raw data and to demonstrate that existing community efforts in curation and deployment of biomedical software can reliably support rapid, reproducible research during global health crises.<br/>

*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- Here again, the establishing a unique decision tree to support National decision about medicine importation/exportation could be useful to reduce the fragmentation of shortage-mitigating strategies among European countries and to improve the effectiveness of the National strategic plan to satisfy the patients' needs, without altering the National regulatory framework.<br/>
- For these products, more centralized coordination of the risk control strategies by the EMA and, consequently, a more efficient sharing of information among National Regulatory Authorities are needed to better mitigation of shortage impact at a national level and to fulfil the needs of all the patients.<br/>
- On the other side, if the shortage impact of medicinal products on the public health is low, it is not reasonable to charge the MAHs with additional costs and, therefore, affect the economic sustainability for the implementation of quality assurance systems that may have a limited positive impact on the continuity of care.<br/>

*The Lancet - Mar 06, 2020*<br/>
-    In the short term, travel restrictions prevent supplies from getting into affected areas, slow down the international public health response, stigmatise entire populations, and disproportionately harm the most vulnerable among us.<br/>
- 10 Under no circumstances should public health or foreign policy decisions be based on the racism and xenophobia that are now being directed at Chinese people and those of Asian descent.<br/>
- This will exacerbate inequities, with those who have more financial and social capital having more options.<br/>
- Having lost homes or livelihoods, and fearful for the future, some people might leave their communities and perhaps their country.<br/>

[How African migrants in China cope with barriers to health care](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30048-7)<br/>

*The Lancet Public Health - 2020*<br/>
- How African migrants in China cope with barriers to health care<br/>
- 2 Despite the powerful community coping strategy of African migrants in China, their social and structural barriers to health care should be taken into consideration in implementing Africa-China health cooperation plans, 1 particularly during the current outbreak of COVID-19.<br/>
- This community unity is crucial in the current climate marked with an atmosphere of racial discrimination, police intimidation, and other aspects of social exclusion and harassment that Africans might face in China.<br/>

[Weaponized Interdependence: China's Economic Statecraft and Social Penetration against Taiwan](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orbis.2020.02.002)<br/>
by Chang, Chia-Chien; Yang, Alan H.<br/>
*Orbis - Mar 04, 2020*<br/>
- However, such tours have powerful potential as economic and social statecraft because they target even younger generations, such as teenagers, or the athletes, who face an insecure job market in Taiwan.<br/>
- China's statecraft used to focus on the "three middles and the youth"-the youth, small and medium enterprises, middle-and low-income classes, and the population in the middle and southern Taiwan, who are traditionally considered more pro-independent.<br/>
- To delegitimize democracies and other universal human-rights regimes, authoritarian regimes seek to incite and amplify existing divisions in democratic societies by manipulating or faking the information that reaches them.<br/>

[If containment is not possible, how do we minimize mortality for COVID-19 and other emerging infectious disease outbreaks?](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.20034892)<br/>
by Andreas Handel; Joel Miller; Yang Ge; Isaac Chun-Hai Fung<br/>
*Mar 17, 2020*<br/>
- While school closures have proven to be an important means for delaying or reducing outbreaks , they come with large economic and societal costs, with generally an outsized impact on disadvantaged and vulnerable populations .<br/>
- If an intervention mainly protects specific groups in a population, infections required to achieve population immunity will happen disproportionately in the other groups.<br/>

[On the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak and the Smart City Network: Universal Data Sharing Standards Coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Benefit Urban Health Monitoring and Management](https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare8010046)<br/>
by Allam, Zaheer; Jones, David S.<br/>
*Healthcare - 2020*<br/>
- On the health sector, the same approach is being upheld where critical information and data are not freely shared between economies as that would be seen to be benefiting other in-competition economies, whereas different economies would cherish the maximization of benefits from such data collections.<br/>
- Therefore, geopolitical issues are expected on the technological front as most large data-rich corporations are located in powerful countries that have influence both economically, health-wise and politically   .<br/>

[The neglected health of international migrant workers in the COVID-19 epidemic](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30076-6)<br/>
by Liem, Andrian; Wang, Cheng; Wariyanti, Yosa; Latkin, Carl A; Hall, Brian J<br/>
*The Lancet Psychiatry - Feb 19, 2020*<br/>
- Compared with other international migrants (ie, international students), IMWs encounter more barriers in accessing health services in host countries (eg, inadequate health insurance), particularly migrant domestic workers.<br/>
- In addition, more countries should ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families to provide global health equity and ensure that migrant workers' health is not neglected in future epidemics and disasters.<br/>

[The timing of one-shot interventions for epidemic control](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.20030007)<br/>
by Francesco Di Lauro; IstvÃ¡n Z Kiss; Joel Miller<br/>
*Mar 06, 2020*<br/>
- The impact of the intervention based on the global level of (I + R)(t) [see figure 5 (b,e)] or on the first sub-population to reach a threshold [see figure 5 (c,f)] are similar, but qualitatively different compared to the individually-targeted intervention.<br/>
- Some of these control measures are likely unsustainable.<br/>

by Zaixing Shi; Ya Fang<br/>
*Mar 17, 2020*<br/>
- The correlations between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence were weaker in economically advantaged provinces.<br/>

# Data systems and research priorities and agendas incorporate attention to the needs and circumstances of disadvantaged populations and underrepresented minorities.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Policies and public health efforts have not addressed the gendered impacts of disease outbreaks.<br/>
- In the ongoing epidemic of COVID-19, all these aspects have not yet been fully addressed, although the global public health community is obliged to continually confront the epidemic and make political decisions encompassing travel restrictions, containment measures, and mitigation strategies.<br/>
- These countries may also suffer from poverty, political instability, terrorism, other endemic or epidemic infectious diseases competing for limited public health resources, low levels of literacy, and a lack of diagnostic or research laboratories.<br/>
- It integrates metrics from multiple areas, including demography, health care, public health, political and economic .<br/>
- However, as more data becomes available, the model can be updated, or tailored to particular public health contexts.<br/>

[A disconnected policy network: The UK's response to the Sierra Leone Ebola epidemic](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.112851)<br/>
by Georgalakis, James<br/>
*Social Science & Medicine - Apr 30, 2020*<br/>
- Only by seeking to understand the politics of knowledge and the social and political dynamics of global health and humanitarian networks can we challenge injustice and historically reinforced narratives that favour some perspectives over others.<br/>
- Social scientists were most successful in engaging when they framed their expertise in terms of already widely accepted concepts, such as the need for better communications with communities.<br/>
- Haas helped define epistemic communities and how they differ from other policy communities, such as interest groups and advocacy coalitions (Haas, 1992) .<br/>
- This community did indeed emerge or coalesce around the demand placed on their expertise by policy makers concerned with the community engagement dimensions of the response.<br/>
- In this area, clinicians, humanitarians and policy actors seemed to maintain a policy position directly opposed to anthropological based advice.<br/>
- These interactions were not entirely limited to policy audiences.<br/>

[New regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in Europe](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171)<br/>
by Musazzi, Umberto M.; Di Giorgio, Domenico; Minghetti, Paola<br/>
*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- Considering such critical issues and the latest position papers of stakeholder associations (Various Associations, 2019a,b), the establishment of harmonized metrics to classify the impact of medicine shortage on the National Healthcare Systems is a mandatory step to enhance the cooperation among competent National Authorities of the European countries and to rationalize the efforts to mitigate them.<br/>
- Such strategies cannot be applied to solve all shortage types, and the communications/cooperation among stakeholders may be limited.<br/>
- It is not feasible to introduce economic incentives for all medicinal products since it can affect the budgets of the Regulatory Authorities or, more in general, those of the National Healthcare Systems.<br/>
- Moreover, they also underlined the importance of improving the monitoring of shortages and cooperation in the EU by the establishment of a priority ranking of shortages to address "high-risk" medicinal products efficiently without introducing disproportionate initiatives that could have opposite effects to the ones intended.<br/>
- Indeed, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies adopted by professionals (e.g., pharmacists) and other stakeholders can be rationalized and harmonized based on the medicines shortage impact scores calculated by a competent National Authority.<br/>
- Consequently, in the estimation of the shortage impact on the patient needs, this aspect should be primary for harmonizing the existing metrics and rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted.<br/>

[COVID-19: the gendered impacts of the outbreak](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30526-2)<br/>
by Wenham, Clare; Smith, Julia; Morgan, Rosemary<br/>
*The Lancet - Mar 20, 2020*<br/>
- Although women should not be further burdened, particularly considering much of their labour during health crises goes underpaid or unpaid, incorporating women's voices and knowledge could be empowering and improve outbreak preparedness and response.<br/>
- Policies and public health efforts have not addressed the gendered impacts of disease outbreaks.<br/>
- Recognising the extent to which disease outbreaks affect women and men differently is a fundamental step to understanding the primary and secondary effects of a health emergency on different individuals and communities, and for creating effective, equitable policies and interventions.<br/>
- We call on governments and global health institutions to consider the sex and gender effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, both direct and indirect, and conduct an analysis of the gendered impacts of the multiple outbreaks, incorporating the voices of women on the front line of the response to COVID-19 and of those most affected by the disease within preparedness and response policies or practices going forward.<br/>
- Experience from past outbreaks shows the importance of incorporating a gender analysis into preparedness and response efforts to improve the effectiveness of health interventions and promote gender and health equity goals.<br/>

[On the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak and the Smart City Network: Universal Data Sharing Standards Coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Benefit Urban Health Monitoring and Management](https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare8010046)<br/>
by Allam, Zaheer; Jones, David S.<br/>
*Healthcare - 2020*<br/>
- Therefore, geopolitical issues are expected on the technological front as most large data-rich corporations are located in powerful countries that have influence both economically, health-wise and politically   .<br/>
- On the health sector, the same approach is being upheld where critical information and data are not freely shared between economies as that would be seen to be benefiting other in-competition economies, whereas different economies would cherish the maximization of benefits from such data collections.<br/>
- With such an approach, it would be easier to share urban health data across geographies to better monitor emerging health threats in order to provide more economic stability, thereby ensuring no disruptions on such sectors like tourism and travel industries, amongst others.<br/>
- Therefore, it becomes paramount to ensure that the measures taken to contain a virus transcend nationalist agendas where data and information sharing is normally restricted, to a more global agenda where humanity and global order are encouraged.<br/>
- These associated benefits with big data are clearly influencing geopolitical standings, in both corporate and conventional governance realms, and there is increased competition between powerful economies to ensure that they have the maximum control of big data.<br/>

[Responding to health emergencies in the Eastern Mediterranean region in times of conflict](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30069-6)<br/>
by Brennan, Richard; Hajjeh, Rana; Al-Mandhari, Ahmed<br/>
*The Lancet - Mar 02, 2020*<br/>
- Nonetheless, the health sector has much more to do and WHO has identified priorities for improving the collective health response.<br/>
- 15 Humanitarian agencies have adopted various approaches to address these constraints, including investments in local partners, cross-border operations, deconfliction, remote programming, and scaled up advocacy and humanitarian diplomacy.<br/>
- Effective humanitarian response is constrained by insecurity, disrupted health systems, limited local capacities, bureaucratic impediments, insufficient partners with strong operational presence, and underfunding.<br/>

[Mitigate the effects of home confinement on children during the COVID-19 outbreak](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30547-X)<br/>
by Wang, Guanghai; Zhang, Yunting; Zhao, Jin; Zhang, Jun; Jiang, Fan<br/>
*The Lancet - Mar 04, 2020*<br/>
- Any sustainable programme must involve local professionals to culturally adapt the interventions to the administrative system and to the regional and community environment, and it must develop contextually relevant material for children and adolescents.<br/>
- To mitigate the consequences of home confinement, the government, nongovernmental organisations (NGOs), the community, school, and parents need to be aware of the downside of the situation and do more to effectively address these issues immediately.<br/>
- The government might mobilise existing resources, perhaps involving NGOs, and create a platform for gathering the best online education courses about healthy lifestyle and psychosocial support programmes available for schools to choose from.<br/>

*Int Health - Feb 10, 2020*<br/>
- 9,10 Further research to identify the risk factors among different populations will help develop more locally-relevant and fine-tuned risk mitigation strategies and address the social and ecological bias to identifying recommendations for other community settings.<br/>
- 14 However, detailed knowledge of the social and ecological mechanisms of zoonotic disease emergence in the region is limited, and therefore cannot yet inform evidence-based policies and practices for targeted surveillance programmes.<br/>

- In addition, more countries should ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families to provide global health equity and ensure that migrant workers' health is not neglected in future epidemics and disasters.<br/>
- 5 Regardless of IMWs communities' self-reliance and resilience, addressing their health needs should be made an urgent public health priority because infection among these individuals could also lead to community infection, eventually affecting the entire population's health.<br/>

# Mitigating threats to incarcerated people from COVID-19, assuring access to information, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

#### Highlights<br/>
- In the absence of effective treatments and vaccines, an early adoption of stringent public health measures is crucial in mitigating the scale and burden of an outbreak.<br/>
- Thus, an efficient and timely triage of COVID-19 patients with high mortality risk is crucial for relieving the public health burden.<br/>
- Learning from the effective measures used and problems encountered in the prevention and control of this epidemic, the government is likely to set up an emergency decision-making organization when responding to future public health emergencies.<br/>
- Reliable, timely laboratory diagnosis and an effective vaccine are crucial for effective disease management and public health intervention.<br/>
- Effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources.<br/>

*Epidemiol Infect.; 148:e22 - 2020*<br/>
- Another key factor in successfully preventing and managing emerging threats is the rapid and transparent sharing of information between countries and agencies.<br/>
- This is always a challenging process when balancing the resources focussed on analysing the situation on the ground with resources directed at interpreting the information for journalists but in SARS, the R 0 was seen to decrease in response to information reaching the public and the public then adopting risk reduction actions ; so accurate public risk communication is critical to success.<br/>

*The Lancet - Mar 17, 2020*<br/>
- Preparedness is the key to navigating any public health crisis, and malariaendemic countries must be prepared for the challenges that COVID-19 might bring while minimising disruption to malaria control.<br/>
- Such measures would also aid efforts in COVID-19 management by reducing the strain on medical resources and minimising confounding factors in diagnosis.<br/>

*The Lancet - Mar 20, 2020*<br/>
- Timely, accurate, and transparent risk communication is essential and challenging in emergencies because it determines whether the public will trust authorities more than rumours and misinformation.<br/>
- However, their response is vulnerable to shortcomings in the coordination of services; access to adequate medical supplies and equipment; adequacy of risk communication; and public trust in government.<br/>

# Understanding coverage policies (barriers and opportunities) related to testing, treatment, and care
#### Highlights<br/>
- 31 Existing local preliminary programmes and policies around human and animal health, community development and conservation are considered effective resources to begin or continue developing cost-effective strategies to mitigate zoonotic risks.<br/>
- We hope that these insights may help to mitigate the global impacts of COVID-19 by guiding effective decision-making in both high-and low-resource countries, and may contribute to prospective improvements in screening policy for future emerging infections.<br/>
- Yet the quantitative performance of different policies matters for planning interventions and will influence how public health authorities prioritize different measures as the international and domestic context changes.<br/>
- Effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources.<br/>
- First, close monitoring is needed of changes in epidemiology and of the effectiveness of public health strategies and their social acceptance.<br/>

[New regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in Europe](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171)<br/>
by Musazzi, Umberto M.; Di Giorgio, Domenico; Minghetti, Paola<br/>
*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- For mitigating shortages that affect the Union, the stronger coordination at EU-level and the harmonization of communication, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies are desirable and urgent.<br/>
- In this way, the resulting metrics allow promoting, on the one hand, the harmonization of the risk assessment of the shortages at EU level and, on the other hand, the rationalization of the preventing management strategies in a cause-specific matter.<br/>
- This manuscript aims to review the current upgrade of the European regulatory framework on medicine shortages and to propose a theoretical approach for 1) determining the shortage/unavailability impact on the capability of the National Healthcare Systems and 2) rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted in function of the leading cause of shortage (e.g., production, price and importation/exportation).<br/>
- Consequently, in the estimation of the shortage impact on the patient needs, this aspect should be primary for harmonizing the existing metrics and rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted.<br/>
- Noteworthy, it is not expectable that such provisions can solve the economic sustainability of a product in a long-term perspective, but there is no doubt that they can mitigate the MAH situations in short and medium-term, allowing the adoption of proper strategies to rationalize the production and to improve MAH sustainability.<br/>
- Indeed, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies adopted by professionals (e.g., pharmacists) and other stakeholders can be rationalized and harmonized based on the medicines shortage impact scores calculated by a competent National Authority.<br/>
- The second HMA/EMA guideline, "Good practice guidance for communication to the public on medicines' availability issues", aimed to enhance and align the European communication on a shortage to improve the awareness of healthcare professionals and patients and the cooperation among European stakeholders (EMA and HMA, 2019b).<br/>

*Mar 13, 2020*<br/>
- Decision-making and implementations may require adaptations and modifications to take into account setting-specific characteristics in terms of community features, local epidemiology and risk assessment, social habits, juridical provisions, organizational coordination, and availability of economic-financial resources.<br/>
- However, in the absence of effective medical interventions, these measures must be implemented and the success of these measures, despite their disruptive impact on social-economic activities, depends heavily on how these measures are adapted to the specific scenario, in terms not only of clinical and epidemiological variables but also of social aspects, including social habits, juridical provisions, and economic-financial resources.<br/>

- We hope that these insights may help to mitigate the global impacts of COVID-19 by guiding effective decision-making in both high-and low-resource countries, and may contribute to prospective improvements in screening policy for future emerging infections.<br/>
- Yet the quantitative performance of different policies matters for planning interventions and will influence how public health authorities prioritize different measures as the international and domestic context changes.<br/>

[How health anxiety influences responses to viral outbreaks like COVID-19: What all decision-makers, health authorities, and health care professionals need to know](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102211)<br/>
by Asmundson, Gordon J.G.; Taylor, Steven<br/>
*Journal of Anxiety Disorders - Apr 30, 2020*<br/>
- Accordingly, it is critical that public health decision-makers, health authorities, and health care providers across disciplines understand how health anxiety will influence responses to viral outbreaks, including current responses to COVID-19.<br/>
- In the meantime, basic knowledge of how high and low levels of health anxiety will impact behaviour as it relates to strategies for containing and mitigating viral spread is important for all decision-makers, health authorities, and health care professional and needs to be communicated to the public in an effort to curb maladaptive or irresponsible decisions that may negatively impact these efforts.<br/>
