# Methods for coordinating data-gathering with standardized nomenclature.

#### Highlights<br/>
- At the time of writing, efforts are underway to coordinate compilation of COVID-19 data from online sources across several academic teams. [Sun et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2589-7500(20)30026-1)<br/>
- Data were evaluated and collected, by using a case record form modified from the standardised International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium case report forms. [Yang et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30079-5)<br/>
- Personal, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcomes information were obtained with standardized data collection forms from electronic medical records. [Xing et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.20033159)<br/>
- Diagnostic criteria and clinical classification of all confirmed COVID-19 cases were based on guidelines of National Health Commission. [Chen et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030353)<br/>
- Data from before the 10 th January was not included in this analysis because cases identified before 10 th January were based on symptomatic diagnosis and no standardized testing method was available. [Li et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024315)<br/>

# Understanding and mitigating barriers to information-sharing.

#### Highlights<br/>
- While population age structure is crucial for understanding the populations at the highest risk of mortality both across and within countries, it is also vital for understanding how much social distancing measures are required in each population to reduce the number of most critical cases and overload on the health system-aka "flattening the curve" . [Dowd et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036293)<br/>
- We hope that these insights may help to mitigate the global impacts of COVID-19 by guiding effective decision-making in both high-and low-resource countries, and may contribute to prospective improvements in screening policy for future emerging infections. [Gostic et al](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.55570)<br/>
- The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic affecting the human respiratory system severely challenges public health and urgently demands for increasing our understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis, especially host factors facilitating virus infection and replication. [Lukassen et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.991455)<br/>
- Policymakers who are thinking of introducing measures to contain COVID-19 may benefit from understanding such health and welling implications. [Zhang et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.20034496)<br/>
- Given the current epidemic and limited understanding of the epidemiology of this disease, our findings on travel patterns from historical data can help contribute to tailoring public health interventions. [Lai et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020479)<br/>

# How to recruit, support, and coordinate local (non-Federal) expertise and capacity relevant to public health emergency response (public, private, commercial and non-profit, including academic).

#### Highlights<br/>
- For pharmacists to assume a role in the health emergency preparedness and response arrangements at community level, public private partnership and the application of real-world data have been shown to be vital. [Ung et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.02.003)<br/>
- To address hospital needs and to receive medical directives, the COVID-19 response team maintains direct contacts with local hospitals and regional public health authorities. [Spina et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30493-1)<br/>
- 6 The provincial governments are responsible for organising, coordinating, and handling all emergency public health treatments, disclosing information, and gathering emergency materials and facilities under the guidance of the State Council. [Bao et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30309-3)<br/>
- WHO's global COVID-19 strategic preparedness and response plan13 therefore prioritises countries with weak health systems for technical and operational support from international partners. [Brennan et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30069-6)<br/>
- CDC mobilized early in the response and state and local health departments similarly increased capacity to provide clinical consultation regarding 2019-nCoV. [Bajema et al](https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6906e1)<br/>

# Integration of federal/state/local public health surveillance systems.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Whilst strong epidemiology and surveillance systems are indispensable tools for the detection and monitoring of outbreaks and public health emergencies, strong primary care systems form the foundation of any emergency response. [Dunlop et al](https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgpopen20X101041)<br/>
- 27, 28 National public health capabilities and infrastructures remain at the core of global health security, because they are the first line of defence in infectious disease emergencies. [Gilbert et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30411-6)<br/>
- The methods used in this study can be applied in surveillance to inform and encourage the general public, public health professionals, clinicians and decision-makers to take coordinative and collaborative efforts to control the epidemic. [Xinguang Chen et al](https://doi.org/10.1186/s41256-020-00137-4)<br/>
- Chinese health authorities have taken prompt public health measures, including intensive surveillance, epidemiological investigations, and closure of the market on 1 January, 2020 ( Figure 1 ). [Amodio et al](https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare8010051)<br/>
- WHO's global COVID-19 strategic preparedness and response plan 13 therefore prioritises countries with weak health systems for technical and operational support from international partners. [Brennan et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30069-6)<br/>

# Value of investments in baseline public health response infrastructure preparedness

#### Highlights<br/>
- WHO's global COVID-19 strategic preparedness and response plan 13 therefore prioritises countries with weak health systems for technical and operational support from international partners. [Brennan et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30069-6)<br/>
- Experience from past outbreaks shows the importance of incorporating a gender analysis into preparedness and response efforts to improve the effectiveness of health interventions and promote gender and health equity goals. [Wenham et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30526-2)<br/>
- The "Level 1 Emergency Response to major public health emergencies" was implemented, and comprehensive epidemic prevention began. [Pan et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2020.02.004)<br/>
- Making advance preparations for a pandemic may bring us significant short-term benefits, such as supporting basic health care, encouraging research and development, strengthening interregional cooperation and emergency response systems and biosafety management, and promoting the balanced development of health and security of the world in general. [Pan et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2020.02.004)<br/>
- 20,21 WHO's surveillance system on attacks on health care is active in six EMR countries; 22 data are being used for advocacy and mitigation measures. [Brennan et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30069-6)<br/>

# Modes of communicating with target high-risk populations (elderly, health care workers).

#### Highlights<br/>
- Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people. [Rothan et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102433)<br/>
- Results : Populations of patients that may require tailored interventions are older adults and international migrant workers. [Lima et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112915)<br/>
- Healthcare workers (HCWs) are the primary sector in contact with patients and are an important source of exposure to infected cases in healthcare settings; thus, HCWs are expected to be at high risk of infection. [Bhagavathula et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033381)<br/>
- For individuals with a suspected infection who are under quarantine or at home, community health service personnel should provide primary medical care and mental health care. [Duan et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30073-0)<br/>
- 6 Despite the common mental health problems and disorders found among patients and health workers in such settings, most health professionals working in isolation units and hospitals do not receive any training in providing mental health care.

# Risk communication and guidelines that are easy to understand and follow (include targeting at risk populations’ families too).

#### Highlights<br/>
- An understanding of the clinical features will help clinicians to recognize the infected patients and minimize the risk of exposure to others. [Zhang et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.02.014)<br/>
- This article will make a proper interpretation in order to understand the guideline better and help guide the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. [Shi et al](https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20200225-00183)<br/>
- As follow-up continues, we can observe the outcome 345 of more and more patients, and it should be possible to identify early risk factors that 346 indicate a poor prognosis. [Lu et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025031)<br/>
- CT imaging can demonstrate typical features making the diagnosis of COVID-19 quite likely, which can help to rapidly screen patients, and to stratify the patients' severity to quickly develop effective treatment strategies. [Liu et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.108941)<br/>
- Second, screening depends on whether exposure risk factors exist that would 271 facilitate specific and reasonably sensitive case detection by questionnaire. [Gostic et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019224)<br/>

# Communication that indicates potential risk of disease to all population groups.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Age and sex distributions are important in understanding risk of infection across populations. [Source](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.20026708)<br/>
- There was no significant difference in sex between the two groups (P > 0.05). [Liu et al](https://doi.org/10.1097/CM9.0000000000000775)<br/>
- Thus, the exact implications of school closure in redistributing the risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among community members of different age groups remain uncertain. [Handel et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.20034892)<br/>
- Again, the results showed that blood group A was associated with a significantly higher risk for COVID-19 (OR, 1.21; 95% CI 1.02~1.43, P = 0.027) compared with non-A blood groups, whereas blood group O was associated with a significantly lower risk for the infection (OR, 0.67; 95% CI 0.60~0.75, P < 0.001) compared with non-O blood groups. [Zhao et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.20031096)<br/>
-  There were statistically significant differences in the expression levels of interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) and IL-6 in the serum of the three groups (P<0.05), among which the critical group was higher than the severe group and the severe group was higher than the mildgroup.

# Misunderstanding around containment and mitigation.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Interpretation: Handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing as a reaction to information dissemination about COVID-19 can be effective strategies to mitigate and delay the epidemic. [Teslya et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034827)<br/>
- B that removal of susceptibles from the transmission process is more effective than quarantine in mitigating epidemic spread. [Maier et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024414)<br/>
- Despite drastic containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing. [Devaux et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105938)<br/>
- Thus, all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread of the 2019-nCoV infection . [Lai et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020479)<br/>
- Countries have to face the reality that individualcase containment might not be possible in the long run, and there might be the need to move from containment to mitigation, balancing the costs and benefits of public health measures.

#### Highlights<br/>
- WHO's global COVID-19 strategic preparedness and response plan 13 therefore prioritises countries with weak health systems for technical and operational support from international partners. [Brennan et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30069-6)<br/>
- In future, when combating with novel infectious diseases and public health emergencies, the response capacity of public health system and treatment capacity of clinical system will be significantly improved, while the situation on insufficient integration of prevention and treatment is bound to be reversed. [Tao et al](https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112150-20200304-00246)<br/>
-  timely mental health care needs to be developed urgently. [Carvalho et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112902)<br/>
- Effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources. [Wu et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.11.20020735)<br/>
- The Ministry of Health, through the Health Alert and Emergency Coordination Center, leads the response effectively, working with the Public Health Services of the Autonomous Communities. [Trilla et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medcle.2020.02.001)<br/>

- Results : Populations of patients that may require tailored interventions are older adults and international migrant workers. [Lima et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112915)<br/>
- The current concerns then regarding the 2019-nCoV outbreak must be for low-and middle-income countries where health protection systems tend to be weaker. [Lee et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.02.001)<br/>
- Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people. [Rothan et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102433)<br/>
- Professional and effective mental health services should be designed in order to aid the psychological wellbeing of the population in affected areas, especially those living in hardest-hit areas, females and people with poor sleep quality. [Liu et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112921)<br/>

# Mitigating threats to incarcerated people from COVID-19, assuring access to information, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

#### Highlights<br/>
- 1 The combination of poor health status, social determinants of health, and paucity of adequate care provided in correctional facilities is driving a public health emergency, which is endangering the North American incarcerated population. [Liang et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(20)30096-6)<br/>
- Preparedness is the key to navigating any public health crisis, and malariaendemic countries must be prepared for the challenges that COVID-19 might bring while minimising disruption to malaria control. [Wang et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30561-4)<br/>
- However, their response is vulnerable to shortcomings in the coordination of services; access to adequate medical supplies and equipment; adequacy of risk communication; and public trust in government. [Legido-Quigley et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30551-1)<br/>
- Learning from the effective measures used and problems encountered in the prevention and control of this epidemic, the government is likely to set up an emergency decision-making organization when responding to future public health emergencies. [Pan et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2020.02.004)<br/>
- Patients mainly receive symptomatic treatment and care for the prevention of complications, while supplementary medical services also appear to be very effective for infected people. [sun et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.20030973)<br/>

# Understanding coverage policies (barriers and opportunities) related to testing, treatment, and care
#### Highlights<br/>
- 31 Existing local preliminary programmes and policies around human and animal health, community development and conservation are considered effective resources to begin or continue developing cost-effective strategies to mitigate zoonotic risks. [Li et al](https://doi.org/10.1093/inthealth/ihaa001)<br/>
- We hope that these insights may help to mitigate the global impacts of COVID-19 by guiding effective decision-making in both high-and low-resource countries, and may contribute to prospective improvements in screening policy for future emerging infections. [Gostic et al](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.55570)<br/>
- Psychological factors are known to play a vital role in the success of public health strategies used to manage epidemics and pandemics; that is, risk communication, vaccination and antiviral therapy, hygiene practices, and social distancing. [Asmundson et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102211)<br/>
- Public education about rabies was reported as an example of a zoonotic disease prevention programme that had improved local awareness of the need for protective measures and postexposure treatment. [Li et al](https://doi.org/10.1093/inthealth/ihaa001)<br/>
- No study has focused on the practical implications of public health interventions and measures. [Tang et al](https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9020462)<br/>
