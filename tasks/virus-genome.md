# Evidence that livestock could be infected (e.g., field surveillance, genetic sequencing, receptor binding) and serve as a reservoir after the epidemic appears to be over.

#### Highlights<br/>
- While it is now commonly recognized that bats such as Rhinolophus affinis may serve as the natural reservoir of 2019-nCoV 1 , it is still unclear which animal serves as an intermediate host that brought the bat coronavirus to human hosts.<br/>
- Efforts have been made to search for a reservoir host or intermediate carriers from which the infection may have spread to humans.<br/>
- Currently available data suggest that 2019-nCoV infected the human population from a bat reservoir, although it remains unclear if a currently unknown animal species acted as an intermediate host between bats and humans.<br/>
- The virus that was presumed to have initially been transmitted from an animal reservoir to humans possibly via an amplifying host.<br/>
- These methods are useful for detecting novel coronaviruses not only in humans, but also in animals for identification of animal reservoir or intermediate host of 2019-nCoV.<br/>

- However, this theory has now been largely discounted and some researchers point towards bats as a reservoir and doubt that the coronavirus could have originated in animals other than birds or mammals ; they are skeptical that the animal host or hosts of 2019-nCoV can be identified without further field and laboratory research.<br/>
- Preliminary genome sequencing suggested the snake as a likely wildlife reservoir responsible for the current outbreak of 2019-nCoV infection and origin-unknown homologous recombination identified within the spike glycoprotein of the 2019-nCoV may explain snake-to-human cross-species transmission .<br/>

- Infected feces also played an important role in some cluster outbreak cases .<br/>
- Furthermore, climate factors may also play a role in the epidemic spreading.<br/>
- These factors may also play a significant role in coronophobia.<br/>
- However, we also should attach importance to asymptomatic cases which may play a critical role in the transmission process .<br/>
- It has been speculated that prior immunity from infection with related coronaviruses may protect children from SARS infection 22 , which could also play a role for 2019-nCoV.<br/>

# Surveillance of mixed wildlife- livestock farms for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in Southeast Asia.

#### Highlights<br/>
- The Seafood market located at Wuhan, where different types of wild (snakes and marmots) and domesticated (poultry and bats) animals were sold illegally.<br/>
- In 2002, a case of SARS appeared in Guangdong Province, China, and then spread to Southeast Asia and all of the world .<br/>
- The new Wuhan coronavirus [2019-nCoV} epidemic illustrates this well, with spread already of this potentially serious respiratory illness from China as its source to 25 countries in Asia, Oceania, North America and Europe.<br/>
- Originating in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, the epidemic has extended over all the provinces of the country, but also affecting bordering countries, such as Vietnam, Russia, Nepal , and other closely connected regions, such as Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea, and Japan, among others in Asia and abroad   .<br/>
- infection (COVID-19) that started in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China , has spread to all 43 parts of China, other parts of Asia such as Japan and Thailand, Australia, Europe and 44 North America.<br/>

- However, given the size of the wildlife farming industry in China, routine disease surveillance and veterinary care at farms and in transport to markets would need to be improved.<br/>
- China is located within a major 'emerging disease hotspot' in Southeast Asia, but there is also a high risk of future diseases originating in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America .<br/>
- The finding of people in a small sample of rural communities in southern China seropositive for a bat SARSr-CoV suggests that bat-origin coronaviruses commonly spillover in the region .<br/>
- Further, we estimate that there are thousands of other CoVs in bats across Southeast Asia, many of which will have pandemic potential.<br/>

# Animal host(s) and any evidence of continued spill-over to humans

#### Highlights<br/>
- SARS-CoV-2 is likely a bat-origin coronavirus that was transmitted to humans through a spill over from bats or through an undetermined yet intermediate animal host (avian, swine, phocine, bovine, canine, other species) or wild animals.<br/>
- Currently available data suggest that 2019-nCoV infected the human population from a bat reservoir, although it remains unclear if a currently unknown animal species acted as an intermediate host between bats and humans.<br/>
- Indeed, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats, the natural reservoir, but transmitted to humans via intermediate host civets and camels, respectively.<br/>
- MERS-CoV was suggested to originate from bats, but the reservoir host fueling spillover to humans is unequivocally dromedary camels (Haagmans et al., 2014; Memish et al., 2013) .<br/>
- SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats, both jumping species to infect humans through different intermediate hosts ( Figure 1B) .<br/>

- Research on the psychological reactions to previous epidemics and pandemics suggests that various psychological vulnerability factors may play a role in coronaphobia, including individual difference variables such as the intolerance of uncertainty, perceived vulnerability to disease, and anxiety (worry) proneness (Taylor, 2019) .<br/>
- Research from other outbreaks of infectious disease suggests that individual difference variables such as the perceived vulnerability to disease may play a role in both coronaphobia and coronavirus-related xenophobia (Taylor, 2019) .<br/>

- Given the ubiquity of comorbidities in the elderly population, and their increased susceptibility to severe COVID-19 infection , knowledge on the differing prevalence and risk of various conditions may help to focus and tailor public health efforts such as the screening of asymptomatic individuals, risk communication, contact tracing, self-isolation and social distancing.<br/>

# Sustainable risk reduction strategies
#### Highlights<br/>
- A key measurable goal for the success of health policy is assessing Universal Health Coverage, including access to effective and safe medicines and other health targets within the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.<br/>
- However, there is a strong need for proper and effective risk-assessment and problemsolving strategies to reduce nationwide shortages without wasting money and time.<br/>
- This strategy will improve effective control strategies to ultimately contain the virus and protect the health of the public.<br/>
- In the absence of effective treatments and vaccines, an early adoption of stringent public health measures is crucial in mitigating the scale and burden of an outbreak.<br/>
- There is an urgent need for the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies for 2019-nCoV outbreak.<br/>

[New regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in Europe](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171)<br/>

*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- Noteworthy, it is not expectable that such provisions can solve the economic sustainability of a product in a long-term perspective, but there is no doubt that they can mitigate the MAH situations in short and medium-term, allowing the adoption of proper strategies to rationalize the production and to improve MAH sustainability.<br/>
- For mitigating shortages that affect the Union, the stronger coordination at EU-level and the harmonization of communication, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies are desirable and urgent.<br/>
- However, there is a strong need for proper and effective risk-assessment and problemsolving strategies to reduce nationwide shortages without wasting money and time.<br/>
- In this way, the resulting metrics allow promoting, on the one hand, the harmonization of the risk assessment of the shortages at EU level and, on the other hand, the rationalization of the preventing management strategies in a cause-specific matter.<br/>
- This manuscript aims to review the current upgrade of the European regulatory framework on medicine shortages and to propose a theoretical approach for 1) determining the shortage/unavailability impact on the capability of the National Healthcare Systems and 2) rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted in function of the leading cause of shortage (e.g., production, price and importation/exportation).<br/>
- In this light, it should be flexible enough to rationalize the risk-assessment and risk-management strategies for the mitigation of the shortage effects in different industrial and healthcare settings.<br/>
- Consequently, in the estimation of the shortage impact on the patient needs, this aspect should be primary for harmonizing the existing metrics and rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted.<br/>
- If such tools are strongly necessary for highshortage-impact products, their adoption as a preventive action to monitor medium-and low-impact products is also desirable.<br/>
- Moreover, the promising results obtained by some National competent Authorities (e.g., AIFA) suggested that setting up cooperation schemes between administration and other stakeholders, fostering a responsible approach in managing crisis in medicines supply, also allowing, for instance, surveillance/verification programs that may represent rational and effective preventive strategies to monitor the activities of exporting wholesalers and distributors for reducing the risks of product unavailability.<br/>
- Moreover, they also underlined the importance of improving the monitoring of shortages and cooperation in the EU by the establishment of a priority ranking of shortages to address "high-risk" medicinal products efficiently without introducing disproportionate initiatives that could have opposite effects to the ones intended.<br/>

[What is ahead for health policy and technology in the 2020s?](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlpt.2020.02.003)<br/>
by Singer, Donald R.J.; Redekop, Ken<br/>
*Health Policy and Technology - Mar 31, 2020*<br/>
- A key measurable goal for the success of health policy is assessing Universal Health Coverage, including access to effective and safe medicines and other health targets within the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.<br/>
- Trade and tariff barriers arising from evolving isolationist policies of the USA are also likely to restrict progress on implementation and the health impact of achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, not least through increased international costs of diagnostics, devices and medicines.<br/>
- These considerations are vital to ensure effective and sustainable development and delivery of health policy and technology over the next decade and beyond.<br/>
- These goals have important public health implications and require coordinated national and international action on economic, environmental and social development.<br/>

by Anderson, Roy M; Heesterbeek, Hans; Klinkenberg, Don; Hollingsworth, T Déirdre<br/>
*The Lancet - Mar 09, 2020*<br/>
- A key issue for epidemiologists is helping policy makers decide the main objectives of mitigation-eg, minimising morbidity and associated mortality, avoiding an epidemic peak that overwhelms health-care services, keeping the effects on the economy within manageable levels, and flattening the epidemic curve to wait for vaccine development and manufacture on scale and antiviral drug therapies.<br/>
- Indicating what level of transmission reduction is required for social distancing interventions to mitigate the epidemic is a key activity (figure).<br/>

- 2(C and D) ), emphasizing the importance of sustaining the implemented control strategies such as self-isolation in order to reduce the susceptibility.<br/>
- Under the scenario of adopting the strongest prevention and control strategy and improving the level of detection and treatment in China, the previously estimated basic reproduction number is no longer suitable for evaluating the epidemic trend in the near future.<br/>
