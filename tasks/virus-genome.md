- However, this theory has now been largely discounted and some researchers point towards bats as a reservoir and doubt that the coronavirus could have originated in animals other than birds or mammals; they are skeptical that the animal host or hosts of 2019-nCoV can be identified without further field and laboratory research.<br/>
- Preliminary genome sequencing suggested the snake as a likely wildlife reservoir responsible for the current outbreak of 2019-nCoV infection and origin-unknown homologous recombination identified within the spike glycoprotein of the 2019-nCoV may explain snake-to-human cross-species transmission.<br/>

- The Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces in southern China were selected for this study because of their historical importance in the origin of emerging infectious diseases, 16 diverse wildlife population within protected forests 17 and intensive wildlife farming and trade activities.<br/>
- 3 People living in the rural areas of southern China primarily cultivate rice and fruits, raise swine and poultry in households or on small farms, 4 but also traditionally hunt wild animals as an alternative income source.<br/>
- 5 The mixed landscape has abundant crops, which attracts wild animals into the communities, and livestock rearing is common.<br/>

*Biosafety and Health - 2020*<br/>
- China is located within a major 'emerging disease hotspot' in Southeast Asia, but there is also a high risk of future diseases originating in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America.<br/>
- However, given the size of the wildlife farming industry in China, routine disease surveillance and veterinary care at farms and in transport to markets would need to be improved.<br/>
- The finding of people in a small sample of rural communities in southern China seropositive for a bat SARSr-CoV suggests that bat-origin coronaviruses commonly spillover in the region.<br/>
- Further, we estimate that there are thousands of other CoVs in bats across Southeast Asia, many of which will have pandemic potential.<br/>

*Int Health - Feb 10, 2020*<br/>
- With further urbanization, and subsequent increased interactions between human populations and the changing ecosystems, new risk factors for zoonotic disease transmission will likely emerge.<br/>
- Using a qualitative approach, this study allowed us to explore a variety of risk factors at different individual, community and policy levels to contextualize the risks of zoonotic disease emergence in local communities.<br/>
- The findings provide guidance for future in-depth research on specific risk factors, as well as zoonotic disease control and prevention in southern China and potentially other regions with similar ecological and social contexts.<br/>
- This study provided evidence of human-animal interactions in rural communities of southern China that increase the potential for zoonotic disease emergence and suggested opportunities for risk mitigation.<br/>
- 9,10 Further research to identify the risk factors among different populations will help develop more locally-relevant and fine-tuned risk mitigation strategies and address the social and ecological bias to identifying recommendations for other community settings.<br/>

- Noteworthy, it is not expectable that such provisions can solve the economic sustainability of a product in a long-term perspective, but there is no doubt that they can mitigate the MAH situations in short and medium-term, allowing the adoption of proper strategies to rationalize the production and to improve MAH sustainability.<br/>
- For mitigating shortages that affect the Union, the stronger coordination at EU-level and the harmonization of communication, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies are desirable and urgent.<br/>
- In this way, the resulting metrics allow promoting, on the one hand, the harmonization of the risk assessment of the shortages at EU level and, on the other hand, the rationalization of the preventing management strategies in a cause-specific matter.<br/>
- However, there is a strong need for proper and effective risk-assessment and problemsolving strategies to reduce nationwide shortages without wasting money and time.<br/>
- In this light, it should be flexible enough to rationalize the risk-assessment and risk-management strategies for the mitigation of the shortage effects in different industrial and healthcare settings.<br/>
- If such tools are strongly necessary for highshortage-impact products, their adoption as a preventive action to monitor medium-and low-impact products is also desirable.<br/>
- Moreover, the promising results obtained by some National competent Authorities (e.g., AIFA) suggested that setting up cooperation schemes between administration and other stakeholders, fostering a responsible approach in managing crisis in medicines supply, also allowing, for instance, surveillance/verification programs that may represent rational and effective preventive strategies to monitor the activities of exporting wholesalers and distributors for reducing the risks of product unavailability.<br/>
- This manuscript aims to review the current upgrade of the European regulatory framework on medicine shortages and to propose a theoretical approach for 1) determining the shortage/unavailability impact on the capability of the National Healthcare Systems and 2) rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted in function of the leading cause of shortage (e.g., production, price and importation/exportation).<br/>
- Moreover, they also underlined the importance of improving the monitoring of shortages and cooperation in the EU by the establishment of a priority ranking of shortages to address "high-risk" medicinal products efficiently without introducing disproportionate initiatives that could have opposite effects to the ones intended.<br/>

[What is ahead for health policy and technology in the 2020s?](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlpt.2020.02.003)<br/>

*Health Policy and Technology - Mar 31, 2020*<br/>
- A key measurable goal for the success of health policy is assessing Universal Health Coverage, including access to effective and safe medicines and other health targets within the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.<br/>
- Trade and tariff barriers arising from evolving isolationist policies of the USA are also likely to restrict progress on implementation and the health impact of achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, not least through increased international costs of diagnostics, devices and medicines.<br/>
- The United Nations Sustainable Development Goalsaim for fair and sustainable health at every level globally: from protecting the planet to achieving long-term health, peace and prosperity in local communities.<br/>
- These considerations are vital to ensure effective and sustainable development and delivery of health policy and technology over the next decade and beyond.<br/>
- These goals have important public health implications and require coordinated national and international action on economic, environmental and social development.<br/>

- If so, then the intervention is sustainable.<br/>
- Some of these control measures are likely unsustainable.<br/>
- In general the goal of our intervention is to reduce R(∞), reduce I(t p ), and increase t p .<br/>

- Under the scenario of adopting the strongest prevention and control strategy and improving the level of detection and treatment in China, the previously estimated basic reproduction number is no longer suitable for evaluating the epidemic trend in the near future.<br/>

[How will country-based mitigation measures influence the course of the COVID-19 epidemic?](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30567-5)<br/>

*The Lancet - Mar 09, 2020*<br/>
- Indicating what level of transmission reduction is required for social distancing interventions to mitigate the epidemic is a key activity (figure).<br/>
- A key issue for epidemiologists is helping policy makers decide the main objectives of mitigation-eg, minimising morbidity and associated mortality, avoiding an epidemic peak that overwhelms health-care services, keeping the effects on the economy within manageable levels, and flattening the epidemic curve to wait for vaccine development and manufacture on scale and antiviral drug therapies.<br/>

*Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease - Feb 29, 2020*<br/>
- Thus, most preventive measures are aimed to reduce the risk of infection.<br/>
- In conclusion, it is time to translate research findings into more effective measures, as with other priority diseases, such as a vaccine or effective therapeutic options, aimed at controlling viruses with clear epidemic potential, and to prioritize those interventions, to reduce and control the negative impact of diseases such as those caused by CoV, including the new emerging 2019-nCoV.<br/>
