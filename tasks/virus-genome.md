This combination of a quick sample preparation method with an easy detection process may allow the development of portable, field detection in addition to a rapid screening for point-of-need testing applications. This virus represents an emerging significant public health concern and expanding the scope of diagnostic utility to applications outside of traditional laboratories will enable greater prevention and surveillance approaches. The efforts made here will serve as a model for inevitable future outbreaks where the use of next generation portable diagnostics will dramatically expand the reach of our testing capabilities for better healthcare outcomes.**<br/>

Match (0.5035): **Our work is an initial attempt at quantifying the impact of airline suspensions on COVID-19 direct importation risk. Some of the limitations of the current work can be overcome with more timely data availability and improved model assumptions. Firstly, the current observations are based on first official reports which in some cases can be quite different from first importations. Also, due to the evolving nature of the outbreak and limited observations, the linear estimator coefficients could change with new reports and altered travel conditions. While air traffic data from IATA allows us to quantify population exposure, (a) it is dated and may not be reflective of current conditions; (b) may not be representative of all human mobility between the countries. As we observed, some countries that are geographically closer to China (e.g., Nepal, Thailand and Japan) have very early arrival times (in relation to estimates based on effective distance). This highlights the need to account for multi-modal transport networks for quantifying the risk of global importations. However, this also raises concerns about other countries and regions (such as Pakistan, Myanmar and Northeastern India) which are geographically adjacent to China but haven't reported any cases yet. Notably, many of these regions scored relatively poorly on the indices of societal function, suggesting ties between the openness of a given regional government and the timeliness and accuracy of their data.**<br/>

Match (0.4731): **The initial publications describing genomic features of COVID-19 [1] [2] [3] [4] used Illumina and Oxford nanopore data to elucidate the sequence composition of patient specimens (although only Wu et al.

However, their approaches to processing, assembly, and analysis of raw data differed widely (Table 1) and ranged from transparent [3] to entirely opaque [4] . Such lack of analytical transparency sets a dangerous precedent. Infectious disease outbreaks often occur in locations where infrastructure necessary for data analysis may be inaccessible or unbiased interpretation of results may be politically untenable. As a consequence, there is a global need to ensure access to free, open, and robust analytical approaches that can be used by anyone in the world to analyze, interpret, and share data. Can existing tools and computational resources support such a global need?

Match (0.6262): **Emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases are key contributors to morbidity and mortality in southern China. 1, 2 This region, considered a 'hotspot' for emerging zoonotic diseases, harbours abundant wildlife while also undergoing land use change and natural resource overexploitation leading to intensified humananimal interactions that favour the emergence of zoonotic diseases. 3 People living in the rural areas of southern China primarily cultivate rice and fruits, raise swine and poultry in households or on small farms, 4 but also traditionally hunt wild animals as an alternative income source. 5 The mixed landscape has abundant crops, which attracts wild animals into the communities, and livestock rearing is common. 6 This brings humans and animals into close contact in dense populations, creating a wildlife-livestockhuman interface for zoonotic disease emergence. 7 In recognition of the challenges of emerging infectious diseases after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002 caused by a bat-origin coronavirus, the Chinese government established a national real-time hospital-based infectious disease reporting system. 1 Likewise, live poultry market interventions were initiated in response to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in southern China in 2001. 8 In December 2019 (after the completion of the current study), a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly across China and the world. 9, 10 This virus is a group 2b coronavirus, which includes SARS-CoV and bat SARSr-CoVs, and its closest relative is a virus identified in a Rhinolophus affinis bat from Yunnan. 10, 11 Environmental samples positive for 2019-nCoV were found in an urban market in Wuhan where some of the earliest known human cases originated. 12, 13 This likely index site sold predominantly seafood, but is also thought to sell live wildlife at the market, and a temporary ban on the wildlife trade for food has been put in place across China. These efforts in response to SARS, HPAI and 2019-nCoV represent a reactiondriven response to zoonotic disease outbreaks, whereas, apart from the new temporary ban on wildlife trade, only limited preventative measures are currently being enacted in the region to reduce the risk of future zoonotic disease outbreaks. 14 However, detailed knowledge of the social and ecological mechanisms of zoonotic disease emergence in the region is limited, and therefore cannot yet inform evidence-based policies and practices for targeted surveillance programmes. 15 Using a qualitative approach through ethnographic interviews and field observations, this study aimed to understand interactions among humans, animals and ecosystems, to shed light on the zoonotic risks in these presumed high-risk communities and to develop an evidence base for identifying appropriate strategies for zoonotic risk mitigation.**<br/>

Match (0.5891): **The second question is what is the source of this virus? The evidence is fairly clear: Most of the initial cases were linked to a seafood market that also sold butchered livestock meat and some wildlife. The virus itself appears to have a wildlife (bat) origin similar to SARS-CoV, which also emerged in a wildlife market through the interactions of humans and other animals that acted as the intermediate hosts of the virus [3, 8, 9] . With two disease outbreaks originating in China significantly linked to wildlife markets, this is an obvious target for control programs to prevent future epedemics and pandemics. Indeed, there have already been calls from Chinese conservationists, public health leaders and policy makers to reduce the wildlife consumption. However, banning or even reducing the sale of wild game may not be straightforward and it is challenging to change behaviors that are influenced by Chinese culture and traditions. In addition to a strong belief in the purported curative power of wildlife and their by-products, the consumption of the rare and expensive wildlife has become a social statement of wealth boosted by economic growth. Changing these cultural habits will take time, however, recent behavioral questionnaire data suggests a generational transformation with reduced wildlife consumption in the younger generation [10] . There is no doubt, however, that the wildlife trade has an inherent risk of bringing people close to pathogens that wildlife carry, that we have not yet encountered, and that have the potential of leading to the next outbreak.**<br/>

Match (0.5849): **Determining the animal reservoir and incidental hosts of a virus with evidence of zoonosis such as 2019-nCoV is important for controlling spillover events and limiting human infections. Although the ecological reservoir for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV remain undefined, evidence of viral presence in a variety of animal species has been found. Serologic evidence and the isolation of viral genomic material for SARS-CoVrelated viruses have provided evidence for bats as the putative reservoir for SARS-CoV. While masked palm civets and raccoon dogs were involved in transmission to humans and initially considered potential reservoirs, they are now considered as incidental or spillover hosts [39] [40] [41] . In contrast, dromedary camels are considered to act a reservoir host for MERS-CoV, and over half of primary human infections report contact with camels, however, it is suspected that bats are likely the ancestral host for MERS-CoV or a MERS-CoV-like virus [42, 43] . Zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV likely results from direct contact with intermediate hosts [44] , while human-to-human transmission of both viruses occurs primarily through close contact and nosocomial transmission via respiratory secretions [45, 46] . Considering the animals implicated as reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, along with the conclusions from phylogenetic analyses from us and other groups, these potential reservoirs will be important starting points for investigation of the virus source.**<br/>

Match (0.5832): **The emergence of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan creates a sense of déjà vu with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic in China in 2003. Coronaviruses are enveloped, positivestranded RNA viruses of mammals and birds. These viruses have high mutation and gene recombination rates, making them ideal for pathogen evolution. 1 In humans, coronavirus is usually associated with mild disease, the common cold. Previous emerging novel coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which emerged in the Middle East in 2012, were associated with severe and sometimes fatal disease. MERS-CoV was less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, with the most severe infections mainly in individuals with underlying illnesses. Clinically and epidemiologically, the contemporary 2019-nCoV in China seems to resemble SARS-CoV. The genome of 2019-nCoV also appears most closely related to SARS-CoV and related bat coronaviruses. 2 The infection has now spread widely, with phylogenetic analysis of the emerging viruses suggesting an initial single-locus zoonotic spillover event in November, 2019, 3 There is an increasing focus on the human-animalenvironment disease interface, as encompassed in the One Health concept. Mortalities, disability-adjusted life-years, and billions of dollars of economic losses from these infections demand action and investment in prevention to face novel challenges to human and animal health. Research has led to better understanding of the nature and drivers of cross-species viral jumps, but the detail is still elusive. No reservoir population of bats for SARS and MERS-CoV or Ebola virus have been definitively identified, despite considerable searching, possibly because of the source virus circulating in small and isolated populations. Forensic examination has clarified the human infection sources and multispecies involvement in these diseases, with some species confirmed as competent hosts (eg, camels for MERS-CoV 4 ), bridge (or amplifying) hosts (eg, pigs for Nipah virus, non-human primates for Ebola virus 5 ), or deadend hosts. The crucial checkpoint is the jump and bridging of the viruses to humans, which occurs most frequently through animal-based food systems. In the case of SARS, markets with live and dead animals of wild and domestic origins were the crucible for virus evolution and emergence in the human population. Once the viruses' functional proteins enabled cell entry in civets (Paguma larvata) and racoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), the bridge was established and it was only a matter of time before the jump to humans occurred. 6 Sequence comparison of civet viruses suggested evolution was ongoing; this was further supported by high seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV among civet sellers, suggesting previous cross-species transmission events without necessarily human-tohuman transmission. 7, 8 Similarly, early Ebola virus was mostly associated with bushmeat and its consumption in Africa; Nipah virus is associated with date palm sap, fruit, and domestic pig farms; MERS is associated with the camel livestock industry; and H5N1 arose from viral evolution in domestic and wild birds, to ultimately bring all these cases to humans. The 2019-nCoV is another virus in the pipeline that originated from contact with animals, in this case a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, China.**<br/>

Match (0.5642): **A zoonotic reservoir harkens back to the emergence of both SARS-and MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV, the first highly pathogenic human CoV, emerged in 2002 with transmission from animals to humans occurring in wet markets. Surveillance efforts found SARS-CoV viral RNA in both palm civets and raccoon dogs sold in these wet markets [14] ; however, SARS-CoV was not found in the wild, suggesting that those species served as intermediary reservoir as the virus adapted to more efficiently infect humans. Further surveillance efforts identified highly related CoVs in bat species [15] . More recent work has demonstrated that several bat CoVs are capable of infecting human cells without a need for intermediate adaptation [16, 17] . Additionally, human serology data shows recognition of bat CoV proteins and indicates that low-level zoonotic transmission of SARS-like bat coronaviruses occurs outside of recognized outbreaks [18] . MERS-CoV is also a zoonotic virus with possible origins in bats [19, 20] , although camels are endemically infected and camel contact is frequently reported during primary MERS-CoV cases [21] . For SARS-CoV, strict quarantine and the culling of live markets in SE Asia played a major role in ending the outbreak. With the cultural importance of camels, a similar approach for MERS-CoV was not an option and periodic outbreaks continue in the Middle East. These lessons from SARS and MERS highlight the importance of rapidly finding the source for 2019-nCoV in order to stem the ongoing outbreak.**<br/>

While the search for the natural host highly implicates bats [21] , search for the intermediary host, if any, is ongoing with the suggestions of the pangolin as a host far from certain. While it is premature to implicate any one particular urban source or natural host, the ensuing search will give insight into pathogens with potential to cross over into human transmission.

Match (0.5470): **The wildlife trade has clearly played a role in the emergence of 2019-nCoV, as well as previous diseases in China (SARS) and across the world (e.g. monkeypox in the USA, Ebola in Africa, salmonellosis in the USA and Europe). China's response in the current outbreak was swift and broad: The index market was closed down immediately and once the virus spread, the wildlife trade was banned temporarily in certain provinces, then nationally. Our recent behavioral risk investigations in China identified low levels of environmental biosecurity and high levels of human-animal contact as key risk factors for zoonotic disease emergence, particularly in local wet and animal markets [23] . While the current wildlife trade bans may help disease control at this moment, to prevent future disease emergence, market biosecurity needs to be improved regarding the hygiene and sanitation facilities and regulations, and the source of animals traded at the market. From a viral emergence perspective, farmed animals are likely a lower risk than wild-caught animals. However, given the size of the wildlife farming industry in China, routine disease surveillance and veterinary care at farms and in transport to markets would need to be improved. The connection between this outbreak and wildlife trade have triggered a strong public opinion against wildlife consumption, and scientists have jointly called for an urgent amendment of the Wildlife Protection Law to standardize and manage wildlife trade as a public health and security issue. It requires collaboration among the State Forestry and Grassland Administration, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, State Administration for Market Regulation and public health authorities to tackle this issue as a long-term goal.**<br/>

The rapid identification and containment of a novel coronavirus virus in a short period of time is a reassuring and a commendable achievement by China's public health authorities and reflects the increasing global capacity to detect, identify, define and contain new outbreaks. The latest analysis show that the Wuhan CoV cluster with the SARS CoV.10 (Novel coronavirus -China (01) Whilst several important aspects of MERS-CoV epidemiology, virology, mode of transmission, pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical features, have been defined, there remain many unanswered questions, including source, transmission and epidemic potential. The Wuhan outbreak is a stark reminder of the continuing threat of zoonotic diseases to global health security. More significant and better targeted investments are required for a more concerted and collaborative global effort, learning from experiences from all geographical regions, through a 'ONE-HUMAN-ENIVRONMENTAL-ANIMAL-HEALTH' global consortium to reduce the global threat of zoonotic diseases (Zumla et al., 2016) . Sharing experience and learning from all geographical regions and across disciplines will be key to sustaining and further developing the progress being made. **<br/>

Closer collaboration between local animal and human health authorities within the current epidemic disease prevention programmes will provide educational and training opportunities to promote risk-mitigation knowledge, skills and best practice in local communities. For example, cave monitoring and management is a low-cost and efficient method to help restrict human activities (e.g. recreation and mining) that lead to contact with bats in caves. This is of particular importance given the emergence of 2019-nCoV, which appears likely to be a bat-origin coronavirus. 10, 11 As the first qualitative study in southern China to assess risk factors for zoonotic disease emergence, our scope was limited by current knowledge, only allowing us to focus on known presumed risk factors. With further urbanization, and subsequent increased interactions between human populations and the changing ecosystems, new risk factors for zoonotic disease transmission will likely emerge. This might include changes to the wildlife trade following the temporary ban put in place as a response to the emergence of 2019-nCoV. 9,10 Further research to identify the risk factors among different populations will help develop more locally-relevant and fine-tuned risk mitigation strategies and address the social and ecological bias to identifying recommendations for other community settings.**<br/>

Match (0.4162): **Those under 18 years are a critical group to study in order to tease out the relative roles of susceptibility vs severity as possible underlying causes for the very rare recorded instances of infection in this age group. Are children protected from infection or do they not fall ill after infection? If they are naturally immune, which is unlikely, we should understand why; otherwise, even if they do not show symptoms, it is important to know if they shed the virus. Obviously, the question about virus shedding of those being infected but asymptomatic leads to the crucial question of infectivity. Answers to these questions are especially pertinent as basis for decisions on school closure as a social distancing intervention, which can be hugely disruptive not only for students but also because of its knock-on effect for child care and parental duties. Very few children have been confirmed 2019-nCoV cases so far but that does not necessarily mean that they are less susceptible or that they could not be latent carriers. Serosurveys in affected locations could inform this, in addition to truly assessing the clinical severity spectrum.**<br/>

Match (0.7428): **Emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases are key contributors to morbidity and mortality in southern China. 1, 2 This region, considered a 'hotspot' for emerging zoonotic diseases, harbours abundant wildlife while also undergoing land use change and natural resource overexploitation leading to intensified humananimal interactions that favour the emergence of zoonotic diseases. 3 People living in the rural areas of southern China primarily cultivate rice and fruits, raise swine and poultry in households or on small farms, 4 but also traditionally hunt wild animals as an alternative income source. 5 The mixed landscape has abundant crops, which attracts wild animals into the communities, and livestock rearing is common. 6 This brings humans and animals into close contact in dense populations, creating a wildlife-livestockhuman interface for zoonotic disease emergence. 7 In recognition of the challenges of emerging infectious diseases after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002 caused by a bat-origin coronavirus, the Chinese government established a national real-time hospital-based infectious disease reporting system. 1 Likewise, live poultry market interventions were initiated in response to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in southern China in 2001. 8 In December 2019 (after the completion of the current study), a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly across China and the world. 9, 10 This virus is a group 2b coronavirus, which includes SARS-CoV and bat SARSr-CoVs, and its closest relative is a virus identified in a Rhinolophus affinis bat from Yunnan. 10, 11 Environmental samples positive for 2019-nCoV were found in an urban market in Wuhan where some of the earliest known human cases originated. 12, 13 This likely index site sold predominantly seafood, but is also thought to sell live wildlife at the market, and a temporary ban on the wildlife trade for food has been put in place across China. These efforts in response to SARS, HPAI and 2019-nCoV represent a reactiondriven response to zoonotic disease outbreaks, whereas, apart from the new temporary ban on wildlife trade, only limited preventative measures are currently being enacted in the region to reduce the risk of future zoonotic disease outbreaks. 14 However, detailed knowledge of the social and ecological mechanisms of zoonotic disease emergence in the region is limited, and therefore cannot yet inform evidence-based policies and practices for targeted surveillance programmes. 15 Using a qualitative approach through ethnographic interviews and field observations, this study aimed to understand interactions among humans, animals and ecosystems, to shed light on the zoonotic risks in these presumed high-risk communities and to develop an evidence base for identifying appropriate strategies for zoonotic risk mitigation.**<br/>

Match (0.5830): **The emergence of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan creates a sense of déjà vu with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic in China in 2003. Coronaviruses are enveloped, positivestranded RNA viruses of mammals and birds. These viruses have high mutation and gene recombination rates, making them ideal for pathogen evolution. 1 In humans, coronavirus is usually associated with mild disease, the common cold. Previous emerging novel coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which emerged in the Middle East in 2012, were associated with severe and sometimes fatal disease. MERS-CoV was less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, with the most severe infections mainly in individuals with underlying illnesses. Clinically and epidemiologically, the contemporary 2019-nCoV in China seems to resemble SARS-CoV. The genome of 2019-nCoV also appears most closely related to SARS-CoV and related bat coronaviruses. 2 The infection has now spread widely, with phylogenetic analysis of the emerging viruses suggesting an initial single-locus zoonotic spillover event in November, 2019, 3 There is an increasing focus on the human-animalenvironment disease interface, as encompassed in the One Health concept. Mortalities, disability-adjusted life-years, and billions of dollars of economic losses from these infections demand action and investment in prevention to face novel challenges to human and animal health. Research has led to better understanding of the nature and drivers of cross-species viral jumps, but the detail is still elusive. No reservoir population of bats for SARS and MERS-CoV or Ebola virus have been definitively identified, despite considerable searching, possibly because of the source virus circulating in small and isolated populations. Forensic examination has clarified the human infection sources and multispecies involvement in these diseases, with some species confirmed as competent hosts (eg, camels for MERS-CoV 4 ), bridge (or amplifying) hosts (eg, pigs for Nipah virus, non-human primates for Ebola virus 5 ), or deadend hosts. The crucial checkpoint is the jump and bridging of the viruses to humans, which occurs most frequently through animal-based food systems. In the case of SARS, markets with live and dead animals of wild and domestic origins were the crucible for virus evolution and emergence in the human population. Once the viruses' functional proteins enabled cell entry in civets (Paguma larvata) and racoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), the bridge was established and it was only a matter of time before the jump to humans occurred. 6 Sequence comparison of civet viruses suggested evolution was ongoing; this was further supported by high seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV among civet sellers, suggesting previous cross-species transmission events without necessarily human-tohuman transmission. 7, 8 Similarly, early Ebola virus was mostly associated with bushmeat and its consumption in Africa; Nipah virus is associated with date palm sap, fruit, and domestic pig farms; MERS is associated with the camel livestock industry; and H5N1 arose from viral evolution in domestic and wild birds, to ultimately bring all these cases to humans. The 2019-nCoV is another virus in the pipeline that originated from contact with animals, in this case a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, China.**<br/>

[1] [2] [3] [4] On Jan 26, novel coronavirus was detected in environmental samples from this market by China CDC, suggesting that the virus possibly originated in wild animals sold in the market. [3] [4] This pathogenic virus has been identified as a new strain of coronavirus, which is in the same family as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). [4] [5] The COVID-19 outbreak was declared by World Health Organization as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on Jan 30, 2020. 6 As of Feb 16, 2020, a total of 70,548 cases have been reported in mainland China, with 1,770 resulting deaths. 7 The outbreak has now spread beyond China to twenty-five other countries. 8 The SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were proven to have originated from wild animals. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] The COVID-19 is also likely to have a zoonotic origin. The practice of consuming wild animal products in China dates back to prehistoric times and persists into today. 9 Trade and consumption of wild animals were not well regulated even after SARS. Until the amendment of Wild Animal Protection Act in 2016, the prohibition was firstly added, but only for a short list of the nationally protected animals. Previous studies explored population exposure to live poultry in China, [15] [16] [17] but information on exposure to wild animals is limited.**<br/>

When outbreak characteristics are shared and updated in real-time (Table 1) , these data can contribute to efforts to narrow down the possible range of causative agents. In the case of the outbreak in Wuhan, our calculation of the probability that each pathogen is the causative agent indicates that virological exclusion of influenza viruses, adenoviruses and known virulent coronaviruses associated with SARS and MERS on 3 and 5 January 2020 can be regarded as an "unsurprising" finding.**<br/>

These studies have identified huge numbers of viruses that circulate in nature and have never been characterized at the phenotypic level. Thus, the genome sequence is the only characteristic that is known for the vast majority of viruses, and needs to be used in defining specific viruses. In this framework, a virus is defined by a genome sequence that is capable of autonomous replication inside cells and dissemination between cells or organisms under appropriate conditions. It may or may not be harmful to its natural host. Experimental studies may be performed for a fraction of known viruses, while computational comparative genomics is used to classify (and deduce characteristics of) all viruses. Accordingly, virus naming is not necessarily connected to disease but rather informed by other characteristics.**<br/>

No viruses were identified but the study identified Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Aspergillus flavus in a single patient and several cases of fungal infection were diagnosed including Candida albicans and Candida glabrata.

The advantage of both laboratory [4] and field-based sequencing approaches [5] was illustrated in the West African Ebola virus outbreak in characterising viral infection and also providing an assessment of the contribution of potential co-infections to outcome [6] . Rapid sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 itself provides utility in two main areas. First, specific amplicon-based sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 allows for potential contact tracing, molecular epidemiology and studies of viral evolution. Second, the use of metagenomic approaches like SISPA provides a check on sequence divergence for amplicon-based approaches. This is particularly important for SARS-CoV-2 as the virus could undergo recombination with other human coronaviruses and mutation and this may also affect both vaccine and antiviral efficacy.**<br/>

Match (0.7007): **Determining the animal reservoir and incidental hosts of a virus with evidence of zoonosis such as 2019-nCoV is important for controlling spillover events and limiting human infections. Although the ecological reservoir for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV remain undefined, evidence of viral presence in a variety of animal species has been found. Serologic evidence and the isolation of viral genomic material for SARS-CoVrelated viruses have provided evidence for bats as the putative reservoir for SARS-CoV. While masked palm civets and raccoon dogs were involved in transmission to humans and initially considered potential reservoirs, they are now considered as incidental or spillover hosts [39] [40] [41] . In contrast, dromedary camels are considered to act a reservoir host for MERS-CoV, and over half of primary human infections report contact with camels, however, it is suspected that bats are likely the ancestral host for MERS-CoV or a MERS-CoV-like virus [42, 43] . Zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV likely results from direct contact with intermediate hosts [44] , while human-to-human transmission of both viruses occurs primarily through close contact and nosocomial transmission via respiratory secretions [45, 46] . Considering the animals implicated as reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, along with the conclusions from phylogenetic analyses from us and other groups, these potential reservoirs will be important starting points for investigation of the virus source.**<br/>

Match (0.6673): **The emergence of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan creates a sense of déjà vu with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic in China in 2003. Coronaviruses are enveloped, positivestranded RNA viruses of mammals and birds. These viruses have high mutation and gene recombination rates, making them ideal for pathogen evolution. 1 In humans, coronavirus is usually associated with mild disease, the common cold. Previous emerging novel coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which emerged in the Middle East in 2012, were associated with severe and sometimes fatal disease. MERS-CoV was less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, with the most severe infections mainly in individuals with underlying illnesses. Clinically and epidemiologically, the contemporary 2019-nCoV in China seems to resemble SARS-CoV. The genome of 2019-nCoV also appears most closely related to SARS-CoV and related bat coronaviruses. 2 The infection has now spread widely, with phylogenetic analysis of the emerging viruses suggesting an initial single-locus zoonotic spillover event in November, 2019, 3 There is an increasing focus on the human-animalenvironment disease interface, as encompassed in the One Health concept. Mortalities, disability-adjusted life-years, and billions of dollars of economic losses from these infections demand action and investment in prevention to face novel challenges to human and animal health. Research has led to better understanding of the nature and drivers of cross-species viral jumps, but the detail is still elusive. No reservoir population of bats for SARS and MERS-CoV or Ebola virus have been definitively identified, despite considerable searching, possibly because of the source virus circulating in small and isolated populations. Forensic examination has clarified the human infection sources and multispecies involvement in these diseases, with some species confirmed as competent hosts (eg, camels for MERS-CoV 4 ), bridge (or amplifying) hosts (eg, pigs for Nipah virus, non-human primates for Ebola virus 5 ), or deadend hosts. The crucial checkpoint is the jump and bridging of the viruses to humans, which occurs most frequently through animal-based food systems. In the case of SARS, markets with live and dead animals of wild and domestic origins were the crucible for virus evolution and emergence in the human population. Once the viruses' functional proteins enabled cell entry in civets (Paguma larvata) and racoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), the bridge was established and it was only a matter of time before the jump to humans occurred. 6 Sequence comparison of civet viruses suggested evolution was ongoing; this was further supported by high seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV among civet sellers, suggesting previous cross-species transmission events without necessarily human-tohuman transmission. 7, 8 Similarly, early Ebola virus was mostly associated with bushmeat and its consumption in Africa; Nipah virus is associated with date palm sap, fruit, and domestic pig farms; MERS is associated with the camel livestock industry; and H5N1 arose from viral evolution in domestic and wild birds, to ultimately bring all these cases to humans. The 2019-nCoV is another virus in the pipeline that originated from contact with animals, in this case a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, China.**<br/>

For example, farmed palm civets were suggested to be an intermediate host for SARS to be spilled over to humans although the details on how to link bat and farmed palm civets are unclear [15, 16, 17] In summary, this study suggested pangolins be a natural host of Betacoronavirus, with an unknown potential to infect humans.

Match (0.6283): **A zoonotic reservoir harkens back to the emergence of both SARS-and MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV, the first highly pathogenic human CoV, emerged in 2002 with transmission from animals to humans occurring in wet markets. Surveillance efforts found SARS-CoV viral RNA in both palm civets and raccoon dogs sold in these wet markets [14] ; however, SARS-CoV was not found in the wild, suggesting that those species served as intermediary reservoir as the virus adapted to more efficiently infect humans. Further surveillance efforts identified highly related CoVs in bat species [15] . More recent work has demonstrated that several bat CoVs are capable of infecting human cells without a need for intermediate adaptation [16, 17] . Additionally, human serology data shows recognition of bat CoV proteins and indicates that low-level zoonotic transmission of SARS-like bat coronaviruses occurs outside of recognized outbreaks [18] . MERS-CoV is also a zoonotic virus with possible origins in bats [19, 20] , although camels are endemically infected and camel contact is frequently reported during primary MERS-CoV cases [21] . For SARS-CoV, strict quarantine and the culling of live markets in SE Asia played a major role in ending the outbreak. With the cultural importance of camels, a similar approach for MERS-CoV was not an option and periodic outbreaks continue in the Middle East. These lessons from SARS and MERS highlight the importance of rapidly finding the source for 2019-nCoV in order to stem the ongoing outbreak.**<br/>

Match (0.5921): **Regarding SARS-CoV-2 in particular, there are several aspects that needs a One Health approach in order to understand the outbreak, and to mitigate further outbreaks of a similar virus. SARS-CoV-2 is likely a bat-origin coronavirus that was transmitted to humans through a spill over from bats or through an undetermined yet intermediate animal host (avian, swine, phocine, bovine, canine, other species) or wild animals. Figure 3 depicts a transmission hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, yet the intermediate host is to be determined. The list of animals which were sold range between poultry (turkey, pheasants, geese, roosters, doves, and wild birds (Peacocks swans, and exotic animals, to reptiles and hedgehogs. The animal list included frogs, camels, wild rabbits, reptiles, snakes, deer, crocodiles, Kangaroos, snails, civet cats, goats, centipedes, and cicades [45, 46] . There are no data available in scientific literature on the detection and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from environmental samples. However, it was recently reported that the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention isolated SARS-CoV-2 from 33 samples out of 585 environmental samples collected from Huanan Seafood Market [47] . process, and they need to be addressed in any true One Health approach [48] . However, it is crucial to consider the cultural context of these markets meaning that again, social sciences are important in this process. Also, this means that the most viable solution may not be to close down live animal markets but perhaps to 'sector' them so that fewer different species mingle in one specific market and that the specific intermediate host(s) for SARS-CoV-2 may be removed from the markets, or rigorously tested for the virus.**<br/>

Match (0.5847): **Coronaviruses can be classified into 4 genera (a, b, c, and d) and these viruses are detected in a wide range of animal species, including humans (1) . There are 6 previously known human coronaviruses that can be transmitted between humans. Human alphacoronaviruses, 229E and NL63, and betacoronaviruses, OC43 and HKU1, are common respiratory viruses usually causing mild upper respiratory diseases. In contrast to these, the other 2 human beta-coronaviruses, SARS and MERS coronaviruses, are highly pathogenic in humans. The case fatality rates of SARS and MERS are about 10% and 35%, respectively (2, 3) . SARS and MERS can be transmitted between humans and may cause major outbreaks in health care settings or in community settings. Both SARS and MERS coronaviruses are of zoonotic origins. MERS coronavirus is widely circulated in dromedary camels. Over 90% of dromedary camels in Middle East countries are seropositive for MERS coronavirus (4, 5) . Because of such a high prevalence in this animal species, sporadic zoonotic transmissions of MERS coronavirus from camels to humans have been repeatedly detected in the affected region since its discovery in 2012. For the SARS outbreak in 2003, exotic mammals in wet markets, such as palm civets and raccoon dogs, are believed to be the animal sources of the virus (6) . The detection of SARS coronavirus in these species led to a temporary ban of selling of these animals in 2004, thereby preventing additional spill-over events from animals to humans. But further surveillance studies indicated that these animals are rarely positive for SARS coronavirus in non-market settings, suggesting that they only served as intermediate hosts in the SARS event (1, 7) . Subsequent virus surveillances in wild animals identified a vast number of coronaviruses in bats (8) . Interestingly, several bat coronaviruses that are genetically similar to human SARS coronavirus were detected in horseshoe bats. This group of SARS-like bat coronaviruses, together with SARS coronavirus, form a unique clade under the subgenus Sarbecovirus. It is now generally believed that SARS coronavirus is a recombinant virus between several bat SARS-like beta-coronaviruses (9) . Some of these bat coronaviruses are experimentally capable of infecting human cells in cultures (9), suggesting that these animal viruses and their recombinants can pose threats to human health.**<br/>

Match (0.4933): **The second question is what is the source of this virus? The evidence is fairly clear: Most of the initial cases were linked to a seafood market that also sold butchered livestock meat and some wildlife. The virus itself appears to have a wildlife (bat) origin similar to SARS-CoV, which also emerged in a wildlife market through the interactions of humans and other animals that acted as the intermediate hosts of the virus [3, 8, 9] . With two disease outbreaks originating in China significantly linked to wildlife markets, this is an obvious target for control programs to prevent future epedemics and pandemics. Indeed, there have already been calls from Chinese conservationists, public health leaders and policy makers to reduce the wildlife consumption. However, banning or even reducing the sale of wild game may not be straightforward and it is challenging to change behaviors that are influenced by Chinese culture and traditions. In addition to a strong belief in the purported curative power of wildlife and their by-products, the consumption of the rare and expensive wildlife has become a social statement of wealth boosted by economic growth. Changing these cultural habits will take time, however, recent behavioral questionnaire data suggests a generational transformation with reduced wildlife consumption in the younger generation [10] . There is no doubt, however, that the wildlife trade has an inherent risk of bringing people close to pathogens that wildlife carry, that we have not yet encountered, and that have the potential of leading to the next outbreak.**<br/>

Closer collaboration between local animal and human health authorities within the current epidemic disease prevention programmes will provide educational and training opportunities to promote risk-mitigation knowledge, skills and best practice in local communities. For example, cave monitoring and management is a low-cost and efficient method to help restrict human activities (e.g. recreation and mining) that lead to contact with bats in caves. This is of particular importance given the emergence of 2019-nCoV, which appears likely to be a bat-origin coronavirus. 10, 11 As the first qualitative study in southern China to assess risk factors for zoonotic disease emergence, our scope was limited by current knowledge, only allowing us to focus on known presumed risk factors. With further urbanization, and subsequent increased interactions between human populations and the changing ecosystems, new risk factors for zoonotic disease transmission will likely emerge. This might include changes to the wildlife trade following the temporary ban put in place as a response to the emergence of 2019-nCoV. 9,10 Further research to identify the risk factors among different populations will help develop more locally-relevant and fine-tuned risk mitigation strategies and address the social and ecological bias to identifying recommendations for other community settings.**<br/>

Match (0.4871): **Emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases are key contributors to morbidity and mortality in southern China. 1, 2 This region, considered a 'hotspot' for emerging zoonotic diseases, harbours abundant wildlife while also undergoing land use change and natural resource overexploitation leading to intensified humananimal interactions that favour the emergence of zoonotic diseases. 3 People living in the rural areas of southern China primarily cultivate rice and fruits, raise swine and poultry in households or on small farms, 4 but also traditionally hunt wild animals as an alternative income source. 5 The mixed landscape has abundant crops, which attracts wild animals into the communities, and livestock rearing is common. 6 This brings humans and animals into close contact in dense populations, creating a wildlife-livestockhuman interface for zoonotic disease emergence. 7 In recognition of the challenges of emerging infectious diseases after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002 caused by a bat-origin coronavirus, the Chinese government established a national real-time hospital-based infectious disease reporting system. 1 Likewise, live poultry market interventions were initiated in response to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in southern China in 2001. 8 In December 2019 (after the completion of the current study), a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly across China and the world. 9, 10 This virus is a group 2b coronavirus, which includes SARS-CoV and bat SARSr-CoVs, and its closest relative is a virus identified in a Rhinolophus affinis bat from Yunnan. 10, 11 Environmental samples positive for 2019-nCoV were found in an urban market in Wuhan where some of the earliest known human cases originated. 12, 13 This likely index site sold predominantly seafood, but is also thought to sell live wildlife at the market, and a temporary ban on the wildlife trade for food has been put in place across China. These efforts in response to SARS, HPAI and 2019-nCoV represent a reactiondriven response to zoonotic disease outbreaks, whereas, apart from the new temporary ban on wildlife trade, only limited preventative measures are currently being enacted in the region to reduce the risk of future zoonotic disease outbreaks. 14 However, detailed knowledge of the social and ecological mechanisms of zoonotic disease emergence in the region is limited, and therefore cannot yet inform evidence-based policies and practices for targeted surveillance programmes. 15 Using a qualitative approach through ethnographic interviews and field observations, this study aimed to understand interactions among humans, animals and ecosystems, to shed light on the zoonotic risks in these presumed high-risk communities and to develop an evidence base for identifying appropriate strategies for zoonotic risk mitigation.**<br/>

Match (0.4827): **The finding of people in a small sample of rural communities in southern China seropositive for a bat SARSr-CoV suggests that bat-origin coronaviruses commonly spillover in the region [18] . Single cases or small clusters of human infection may evade surveillanceparticularly in regions and countries that border China with less healthcare capacity or rural areas where people don't seek diagnosis or treatment in a timely fashion. Surveillance programs can be designed by local public health authorities to identify communities living in regions with high wildlife diversity and likely high diversity of novel viruses [21] . People with frequent contact with wild or domestic animals related to their livelihood and occupation, and patients presenting acute respiratory infection (ARI) or influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms with unknown etiology can be included into the surveillance as a cost-effective method to identify novel virus spillovers. This 'pre-outbreak surveillance' strategy can be coordinated with different sectors of public health, healthcare, agriculture and forestry to implement sample collection and testing of wildlife, domestic animals, and people in collaboration with research institutions. These efforts will help identify and characterize viral genetic sequence, identify high-risk human populations with antibodies and cell-mediated immunity responses to wildlife-origin CoVs [22] , as well as the risk factors in human behaviors and living environment through interviews. Evidencebased strategies to reduce risk can then be designed and implemented in the communities where viral spillover is identified.**<br/>

Match (0.5798): **This study provided evidence of human-animal interactions in rural communities of southern China that increase the potential for zoonotic disease emergence and suggested opportunities for risk mitigation. Population migration from rural communities to urban areas for employment, as well as the wild animal protection policy changes in China in recent years, have led to a perceived overall reduction in activities such as household animal raising and wildlife trade. 30, 31 Protective attitudes, knowledge and a supportive social environment for disease prevention were reportedly being developed within the community. 31 Existing local preliminary programmes and policies around human and animal health, community development and conservation are considered effective resources to begin or continue developing cost-effective strategies to mitigate zoonotic risks.**<br/>

Match (0.5444): **Our results have important implications for the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic. If an intervention definitely cannot be sustained for an extended period of time, then it is best if it is "held in reserve" until depletion of susceptibles has reduced the effective reproductive number enough that the one-shot intervention will have maximal impact. However, we must exercise care in determining that an intervention cannot be sustained. The uncertainty about the case fatality rate remains high [9] , and at the higher end of the plausible values, the tolerance of the population for drastic interventions may be significant. Thus what might appear to be an unsustainable intervention may in fact be sustainable if we have a better understanding of the case fatality rate. An additional consequence of our results which is applicable to sustainable interventions is that the expression "better late than never" applies quite strongly for interventions.**<br/>

Match (0.5210): **If and when local transmission begins in a particular location, a variety of community mitigation measures can be implemented by health authorities to reduce transmission and thus reduce the growth rate of an epidemic, reduce the height of the epidemic peak and the peak demand on healthcare services, as well as reduce the total number of infected persons [21] . A number of social distancing measures have already been implemented in Chinese cities in the past few weeks including school and workplace closures. It should now be an urgent priority to quantify the effects of these measures and specifically whether they can reduce the effective reproductive number below 1, because this will guide the response strategies in other locations. During the 1918/19 influenza pandemic, cities in the United States, which implemented the most aggressive and sustained community measures were the most successful ones in mitigating the impact of that pandemic [22] .**<br/>

Match (0.5087): **The coronavirus outbreak has been declared a global health emergency and represents one of the greatest risks to global health, as the virus has a tendency to infect a large number of human populations, and the outbreak can cause severe medical complications with economic impact, particularly in middle-income countries where resources are limited for early diagnosis and preventive measures. Human mobility, air travel, and international trade can likely increase the number of cases in other regions as well. Continued surveillance along with the robust response of government agencies, medical practitioners, and researchers, is highly essential for the effective management of this emerging pathogen. Public health officials need to identify the source and virus reservoir, transmission cycle, pathogenesis, inter-human transmission, and clinical manifestations, which might be helpful to develop animal models, diagnostic reagents, anti-viral therapies, and vaccines against this pathogen. As the virus emerged suddenly and became a serious global concern, there is a need for rapid vaccine development. Although classical expression systems for biopharmaceutical proteins are still amenable, the development of transient expression in plants has deeply influenced the pharmaceutical sector to produce affordable vaccines and biologics rapidly at low cost. Hence, the plant expression platform shall be employed for biopharmaceutical production to accelerate the fight against this deadly infectious disease. The collaborative efforts of researchers are highly desirable to use a plant expression platform for producing an efficient cost-effective vaccine to control this epidemic. The continuous effort of research in this direction might be helpful in producing high-value biologics and pharmaceuticals on a large scale in a short time, especially during epidemics. **<br/>
