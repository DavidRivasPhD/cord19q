# Access to geographic and temporal diverse sample sets to understand geographic distribution and genomic differences, and determine whether there is more than one strain in circulation. Multi-lateral agreements such as the Nagoya Protocol could be leveraged.

#### Highlights<br/>
- This distribution varies among the human population according to the population in different geographic regions of the world. [Basu et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.967422)<br/>
- With more cases being examined from different ethnic and genetic backgrounds worldwide, ACE2 expression variation can be better analysed and compared to establish whether it contributes to susceptibility to COVID-19 across the different subgroups. [Cai et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30117-X)<br/>
- However, these geographical differences in the detection rate may have been affected by several other factors, such as different technical approaches, sampling periods, study durations, or target populations (global population, paediatric population, etc.). [Wang et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.01.017)<br/>
- We included demographic, economic, and geographical factors that are potential contributors to the provincial variation in the association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence. [Shi et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.15.20034199)<br/>
- Assuming homogeneous attack rates across the different age groups, the demographic distribution of cases by age across each location should broadly match the demography of the populations in Wuhan and across the rest of China. [Verity et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033357)<br/>

# Evidence that livestock could be infected (e.g., field surveillance, genetic sequencing, receptor binding) and serve as a reservoir after the epidemic appears to be over.

#### Highlights<br/>
- The expansion of genetic diversity among coronaviruses and their consequent ability to cause disease in human beings is mainly achieved through infecting peridomestic animals, which serve as intermediate hosts, nurturing recombination and mutation events. [Habibzadeh et al](https://doi.org/10.15171/ijoem.2020.1921)<br/>
- Although bats are likely reservoir hosts for 2019-nCoV, the identity of any intermediate host facilitating transfer to humans is unknown. [Lam et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.13.945485)<br/>
- Based on limited sampling of potential reservoir 37 species, SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be most similar to bat coronaviruses at the 38 genomic level, potentially indicating that bats are its natural reservoir  . [Taiaroa et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.976167)<br/>
- Thus, suggested the disease may be transmitted from animals to humans (Fig. [Ahmad et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101607)<br/>
- The current outbreak would result from the acquired ability of the virus to undergo human to human transmission , after the jump from the original animal reservoir (most likely a bat). [Berra et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033522)<br/>

# Evidence of whether farmers are infected, and whether farmers could have played a role in the origin.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Different contact patterns could play a role in a limited outbreak, but not in such a widespread infection, especially as household transmission seems to play a major role . [Riou et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031104)<br/>
- Big data has played and will continue playing an important role in public health. [zheming et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029561)<br/>
- Whatever the source, scientists emphasize that animals should not be vilified for their role in the outbreak. [Graham et al](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-00581-9)<br/>
- Although the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated, current evidence suggests it was transmitted to humans through the spread of wild animals illegally sold in Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market . [Wang et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025288)<br/>
- These factors may also play a significant role in coronophobia. [Asmundson et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102196)<br/>

# Surveillance of mixed wildlife- livestock farms for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in Southeast Asia.

#### Highlights<br/>
- The Seafood market located at Wuhan, where different types of wild (snakes and marmots) and domesticated (poultry and bats) animals were sold illegally. [Ahmad et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101607)<br/>
- 3 People living in the rural areas of southern China primarily cultivate rice and fruits, raise swine and poultry in households or on small farms, 4 but also traditionally hunt wild animals as an alternative income source. [Li et al](https://doi.org/10.1093/inthealth/ihaa001)<br/>
- 4 The 2003 SARS outbreaks are thought to have originated from the spillover of a mutated coronavirus from animals sold in a live animal market in Guangdong province in China to a few humans, and it then surfaced as a large cluster of pneumonia in health-care settings in Guangdong province. [Heymann et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30374-3)<br/>
- 18 Specifically, to lower the risk of zoonotic virus transmission, China has issued strict regulations on wet markets where live and/or wild animals are traded, including closing live poultry markets (LPMs) and bans on wild animal transactions. [Hou et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026146)<br/>
- infection (COVID-19) that started in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China , has spread to all 43 parts of China, other parts of Asia such as Japan and Thailand, Australia, Europe and 44 North America. [Tian et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2020.02.010)<br/>

# Animal host(s) and any evidence of continued spill-over to humans

#### Highlights<br/>
- The ongoing nCoV outbreak highlights the hidden wild animal reservoir of the deadly viruses and possible threat of spillover zoonoses as well. [Malik et al](https://doi.org/10.1080/01652176.2020.1727993)<br/>
- As a result, non-human primates may be susceptible to 2019-nCoV and serve as animal models for antiviral research or intermediate hosts for cross-species transmission. [Li et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.013)<br/>
- The outbreak thus represents a new emerging viral disease due to species "jumping" of an animal virus to humans. [Wu et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.07.20032672)<br/>
- Although bats are likely reservoir hosts for 2019-nCoV, the identity of any intermediate host facilitating transfer to humans is unknown. [Lam et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.13.945485)<br/>
- Due to the frequent interaction between wild animals and humans, wild animals are a common source of human T zoonotic infections. [Fahmi et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104272)<br/>

# Socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors for this spill-over

#### Highlights<br/>
- A main objective of this paper is to quantify the effect of various social and economic factors in mediating the transmission rates of the virus, which may help identify potential behavioral and socioeconomic risk factors for infections. [Qiu et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035238)<br/>
- Secondly, the influence of some 296 important factors, such as socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, were not 297 considered. [Ai et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020339)<br/>
- The risk factors associated with disease severity were analyzed. [Li et al](https://doi.org/10.1097/RLI.0000000000000672)<br/>
- Biological, social and environmental factors have been linked to the emergence of infectious diseases. [Artika et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104215)<br/>
- We also demonstrate that the actual population flow from the outbreak source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. [Qiu et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035238)<br/>

# Sustainable risk reduction strategies
#### Highlights<br/>
- 31 Existing local preliminary programmes and policies around human and animal health, community development and conservation are considered effective resources to begin or continue developing cost-effective strategies to mitigate zoonotic risks. [Li et al](https://doi.org/10.1093/inthealth/ihaa001)<br/>
- This strategy will improve effective control strategies to ultimately contain the virus and protect the health of the public. [Shang et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30361-5)<br/>
- 2 To reduce further spread of the disease, governments have implemented community measures to increase social distancing for those at highest risk of infection. [Peak et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031088)<br/>
- We hope that these insights may help to mitigate the global impacts of nCoV 368 by guiding effective decision-making in both high-and low-resource countries, and may 369 contribute to prospective improvements in travel screening policy for future emerging infections. [Gostic et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019224)<br/>
- The overall reduction of the effective reproductive number is encouraging; however, the control efforts have yet to critically and clearly reduce 4 below 1. [Li et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023127)<br/>

|2020-04-15|Musazzi et al|[New regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in Europe](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171)|Noteworthy, it is not expectable that such provisions can solve the economic sustainability of a product in a long-term perspective, but there is no doubt that they can mitigate the MAH situations in short and medium-term, allowing the adoption of proper strategies to rationalize the production and to improve MAH sustainability.<br/><br/>In this way, the resulting metrics allow promoting, on the one hand, the harmonization of the risk assessment of the shortages at EU level and, on the other hand, the rationalization of the preventing management strategies in a cause-specific matter.<br/><br/>If such tools are strongly necessary for highshortage-impact products, their adoption as a preventive action to monitor medium-and low-impact products is also desirable.<br/><br/>This manuscript aims to review the current upgrade of the European regulatory framework on medicine shortages and to propose a theoretical approach for 1) determining the shortage/unavailability impact on the capability of the National Healthcare Systems and 2) rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted in function of the leading cause of shortage (e.g., production, price and importation/exportation).<br/><br/>Moreover, they also underlined the importance of improving the monitoring of shortages and cooperation in the EU by the establishment of a priority ranking of shortages to address "high-risk" medicinal products efficiently without introducing disproportionate initiatives that could have opposite effects to the ones intended.|
