# Evidence that livestock could be infected (e.g., field surveillance, genetic sequencing, receptor binding) and serve as a reservoir after the epidemic appears to be over.

#### Highlights<br/>
- While it is now commonly recognized that bats such as Rhinolophus affinis may serve as the natural reservoir of 2019-nCoV 1 , it is still unclear which animal serves as an intermediate host that brought the bat coronavirus to human hosts.<br/>
- Efforts have been made to search for a reservoir host or intermediate carriers from which the infection may have spread to humans.<br/>
- Currently available data suggest that 2019-nCoV infected the human population from a bat reservoir, although it remains unclear if a currently unknown animal species acted as an intermediate host between bats and humans.<br/>
-  Genomic analyses indicate that 2019-nCoV may have originated from bats, and current knowledge of other coronaviruses that infect humans, e.g., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, suggests that there may have been intermediate animal hosts.<br/>
- These methods are useful for detecting novel coronaviruses not only in humans, but also in animals for identification of animal reservoir or intermediate host of 2019-nCoV.<br/>

*The Lancet - Feb 28, 2020*<br/>
- Therefore, on the basis of current data, it seems likely that the 2019-nCoV causing the Wuhan outbreak might also be initially hosted by bats, and might have been transmitted to humans via currently unknown wild animal(s) sold at the Huanan seafood market.<br/>
- However, despite the importance of bats, several facts suggest that another animal is acting as an intermediate host between bats and humans.<br/>

# Animal host(s) and any evidence of continued spill-over to humans

#### Highlights<br/>
- Bats are believed to be the natural reservoir of MERS-CoV, and dromedary camels can have the virus and have been suggested as possible intermediary hosts as well as a source of infection to humans .<br/>
- Indeed, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats, the natural reservoir, but transmitted to humans via intermediate host civets and camels, respectively.<br/>
- SARS-CoV-2 is likely a bat-origin coronavirus that was transmitted to humans through a spill over from bats or through an undetermined yet intermediate animal host (avian, swine, phocine, bovine, canine, other species) or wild animals.<br/>
- Currently available data suggest that 2019-nCoV infected the human population from a bat reservoir, although it remains unclear if a currently unknown animal species acted as an intermediate host between bats and humans.<br/>
- SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats, both jumping species to infect humans through different intermediate hosts ( Figure 1B) .<br/>

- This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.<br/>
- However, as a variety of animal species were for sale in the market when the disease was first reported, further studies are needed to determine the natural reservoir and any intermediate hosts of WHCV.<br/>
- The identification of multiple SARS-like CoVs in bats have led to the idea that these animals act as hosts of a natural reservoir of these viruses 22, 23 .<br/>

[New regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in Europe](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119171)<br/>
by Musazzi, Umberto M.; Di Giorgio, Domenico; Minghetti, Paola<br/>
*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- For mitigating shortages that affect the Union, the stronger coordination at EU-level and the harmonization of communication, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies are desirable and urgent.<br/>
- In this way, the resulting metrics allow promoting, on the one hand, the harmonization of the risk assessment of the shortages at EU level and, on the other hand, the rationalization of the preventing management strategies in a cause-specific matter.<br/>
- However, there is a strong need for proper and effective risk-assessment and problemsolving strategies to reduce nationwide shortages without wasting money and time.<br/>
- In this light, it should be flexible enough to rationalize the risk-assessment and risk-management strategies for the mitigation of the shortage effects in different industrial and healthcare settings.<br/>
- If such tools are strongly necessary for highshortage-impact products, their adoption as a preventive action to monitor medium-and low-impact products is also desirable.<br/>
- Moreover, the promising results obtained by some National competent Authorities (e.g., AIFA) suggested that setting up cooperation schemes between administration and other stakeholders, fostering a responsible approach in managing crisis in medicines supply, also allowing, for instance, surveillance/verification programs that may represent rational and effective preventive strategies to monitor the activities of exporting wholesalers and distributors for reducing the risks of product unavailability.<br/>
- This manuscript aims to review the current upgrade of the European regulatory framework on medicine shortages and to propose a theoretical approach for 1) determining the shortage/unavailability impact on the capability of the National Healthcare Systems and 2) rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted in function of the leading cause of shortage (e.g., production, price and importation/exportation).<br/>
- Moreover, they also underlined the importance of improving the monitoring of shortages and cooperation in the EU by the establishment of a priority ranking of shortages to address "high-risk" medicinal products efficiently without introducing disproportionate initiatives that could have opposite effects to the ones intended.<br/>
- Indeed, especially for old medicinal products, the costs of the upgrade to the required high-quality standards and risk assessment plan may be too high to maintain the MAH economic sustainability.<br/>

by Singer, Donald R.J.; Redekop, Ken<br/>
*Health Policy and Technology - Mar 31, 2020*<br/>
- A key measurable goal for the success of health policy is assessing Universal Health Coverage, including access to effective and safe medicines and other health targets within the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.<br/>
- Trade and tariff barriers arising from evolving isolationist policies of the USA are also likely to restrict progress on implementation and the health impact of achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, not least through increased international costs of diagnostics, devices and medicines.<br/>
- The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals aim for fair and sustainable health at every level globally: from protecting the planet to achieving long-term health, peace and prosperity in local communities.<br/>
- These considerations are vital to ensure effective and sustainable development and delivery of health policy and technology over the next decade and beyond.<br/>
- These goals have important public health implications and require coordinated national and international action on economic, environmental and social development.<br/>

- If so, then the intervention is sustainable.<br/>
- Some of these control measures are likely unsustainable.<br/>
- In general the goal of our intervention is to reduce R(∞), reduce I(t p ), and increase t p .<br/>

[How will country-based mitigation measures influence the course of the COVID-19 epidemic?](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30567-5)<br/>
by Anderson, Roy M; Heesterbeek, Hans; Klinkenberg, Don; Hollingsworth, T Déirdre<br/>
*The Lancet - Mar 09, 2020*<br/>
- Indicating what level of transmission reduction is required for social distancing interventions to mitigate the epidemic is a key activity (figure).<br/>
- A key issue for epidemiologists is helping policy makers decide the main objectives of mitigation-eg, minimising morbidity and associated mortality, avoiding an epidemic peak that overwhelms health-care services, keeping the effects on the economy within manageable levels, and flattening the epidemic curve to wait for vaccine development and manufacture on scale and antiviral drug therapies.<br/>

*Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease - Feb 29, 2020*<br/>
- Thus, most preventive measures are aimed to reduce the risk of infection.<br/>
- In conclusion, it is time to translate research findings into more effective measures, as with other priority diseases , such as a vaccine or effective therapeutic options, aimed at controlling viruses with clear epidemic potential, and to prioritize those interventions, to reduce and control the negative impact of diseases such as those caused by CoV, including the new emerging 2019-nCoV.<br/>
