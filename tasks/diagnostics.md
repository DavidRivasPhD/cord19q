# How widespread current exposure is to be able to make immediate policy recommendations on mitigation measures. Denominators for testing and a mechanism for rapidly sharing that information, including demographics, to the extent possible. Sampling methods to determine asymptomatic disease (e.g., use of serosurveys (such as convalescent samples) and early detection of disease (e.g., use of screening of neutralizing antibodies such as ELISAs).

#### Highlights<br/>
- ELISA and GICA for specific IgM and IgG antibodies is conventional serological assays, they can offer a high-throughput alternative, which allows for uniform tests for all suspected patients, and can facilitate more complete identification of infected cases and avoidance of unnecessary cross infection among unselected All rights reserved. [Xiang et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028787)<br/>
- N antibodies do not provide immunity to 2019-nCoV infection, but the cross reactivity with SARS-CoV N protein would allow a serum based assay to determine exposure to the novel CoV in asymptomatic cases. [Gralinski et al](https://doi.org/10.3390/v12020135)<br/>
- Conventional diagnostic testing methods, such as the assays for detection of antiviral antibodies or viral antigens have been developed and used clinically. [Li et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2020.02.002)<br/>
- We performed nucleic acid testing for the confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while coinfection with other pathogens was detected by serological testing of antibodies. [Xing et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.29.20027698)<br/>

# Efforts to track the evolution of the virus (i.e., genetic drift or mutations) and avoid locking into specific reagents and surveillance/detection schemes.

#### Highlights<br/>
- The study showed the existence of genetic drift, due to genetic evolution of the virus. [Artika et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104215)<br/>
- Through the use of crRNA pools targeting different regions of the same virus or different strains of coronavirus, this system could possibly buffer against viral evolution and escape, as well as enable rapid development and deployment against emerging viruses. [Abbott et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.991307)<br/>
- The capability of viral populations to emerge in new hosts can be explained by factors such as rapid mutation rates and recombination 5 which lead to both high genetic variability and high evolutionary rates (estimated to be between 10 -4 and 10 -3 substitutions per site per year) 6 . [Patino-Galindo et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.10.942748)<br/>
- If the gene does not undergo a gradual loss or mutation during subsequent virus circulation in humans, the outbreak could be more severe. [Li et al](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13238-020-00693-y)<br/>
- Sliding window analyses of genetic diversity suggested a certain range in mutations and variation in genomic abundance of SARS-CoV-2, which could be explaining the existing widespread and high adaptation of the deadly virus. [Fang et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.976662)<br/>

When µ and R are small, this variability can be expressed as (µ + R)L. Lethal mutagenesis and incompatible recombinants reduce viability of viral products.|

#### Highlights<br/>
- Together, the results identify key differences in susceptibility to the IFN response between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that could help inform disease progression, treatment options, and animal model development. [Lokugamage et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.07.982264)<br/>
- Our findings will facilitate understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and improve clinical strategies against the disease. [Xu et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30076-X)<br/>
- However, efficient indicators for the disease severity, therapeutic response and disease outcome are still incompletely investigated. [Tan et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029074)<br/>
- These cross-reactive mAbs may serve as tools useful for SARS-CoV-2 research as well as for the development of diagnostic assays for its associated coronavirus disease COVID-19. [Zheng et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.06.980037)<br/>
- Interpretation: COVID-19 severity is associated with increased IgG response, and an immune response phenotyping based on late IgG response and NLR could act as a simple complementary tool to discriminate between severe and nonsevere COVID-19 patients, and further predict their clinical outcome.

# Policies to mitigate the effects on supplies associated with mass testing, including swabs and reagents.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Although China has made great efforts to strengthen the ability to quickly respond to public health emergencies since the SARS outbreak in 2003 and it has clarified requirements for emergency supplies through legislation, the emergency reserve supplies program has not been effectively implemented, and there are also deficiencies in the types, quantity, and availability of emergency medical supplies. [Wang et al](https://doi.org/10.5582/bst.2020.01043)<br/>
- Management of medical supplies and stockpiling of surgical masks and other protective equipment should be done in advance and medical staff should be adequately trained in their use. [Wang et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30561-4)<br/>
- 3, 4 Second, in the use of personal protective equipment, we should try to distinguish different risk factors, adopt different epidemic prevention measures, and reduce the waste of personal protective equipment, as these resources are already in short supply. [Xiao et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30152-3)<br/>
- Meanwhile, the supply of and demand for facemasks and other medical resources should be considered when planning for public health measures, so as to maintain the availability and affordability of medical resources. [Wu et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.11.20020735)<br/>
- In addition, management of environmental infection control including laundry, food service utensils, and medical waste should also be performed. [She et al](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40169-020-00271-z)<br/>

# Barriers to developing and scaling up new diagnostic tests (e.g., market forces), how future coalition and accelerator models (e.g., Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations) could provide critical funding for diagnostics, and opportunities for a streamlined regulatory environment.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics are key pharmaceutical interventions to limit transmission of respiratory infectious diseases. [Pang et al](https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9030623)<br/>
- The tool also allows tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines to stop the COVID-19 disease. [Cleemput et al](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa145)<br/>
- Although these measures might not prevent widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare state and local health departments, health care systems, businesses, educational organizations, and the general public in the event that widespread transmission occurs; and 3) better characterize COVID-19 to guide public health recommendations and the development and deployment of medical countermeasures, including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. [Jernigan et al](https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6908e1)<br/>
- How SARS-CoV-2 evolves over time could have important implications for both strategic planning in public health interventions, prevention of, and development of vaccines and antibodies. [Amodio et al](https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare8010051)<br/>
- 31 Existing local preliminary programmes and policies around human and animal health, community development and conservation are considered effective resources to begin or continue developing cost-effective strategies to mitigate zoonotic risks.

# Enhance capabilities for rapid sequencing and bioinformatics to target regions of the genome that will allow specificity for a particular variant.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Rapid identification of the viral genome and the development of rapid diagnostic tests will facilitate the isolation of those who are confirmed as infected . [Yang et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102434)<br/>
- The genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 has been shared on 10 January, 2020, in order to allow the production of specific diagnostic PCR tests in different countries for detecting the novel infection . [Amodio et al](https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare8010051)<br/>
- The tool also allows tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines. [Cleemput et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.31.928796)<br/>
- Similar to a recently described metagenomic approach for SARS-CoV-2 identification 43 , we also establish a user-friendly multiplex-PCRbased metagenomic method that is not only able to detect SARS-CoV-2, but could also be applied for the identification of significant sequence mutations within known viruses and to uncover novel pathogens with a limited sequencing depth of approximately 1 million reads. [Li et al](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.12.988246)<br/>
- Through the use of crRNA pools targeting different regions of the same virus or different strains of coronavirus, this system could possibly buffer against viral evolution and escape, as well as enable rapid development and deployment against emerging viruses.

#### Highlights<br/>
- Zoonotic viral infections which cause human diseases may come from domestic animals, poultry, livestock and wildlife. [Artika et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104215)<br/>
- Wildlife, especially mammals and birds, are hosts to a large number of viruses. [Artika et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104215)<br/>
- A separate priority is to identify the animal reservoir of this novel pathogen and any intermediary hosts, including potential supply chains of wild or game meat. [Wu et al](https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.3.2000044)<br/>
