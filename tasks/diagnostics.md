*Journal of Clinical Medicine - 2020*<br/>
- The key limitations of serological testing is the need to collect paired serum samples (in the acute and convalescent phases) from cases under investigation for confirmation to eliminate potential cross-reactivity from non-specific antibodies from past exposure and/or infection by other coronaviruses.<br/>
- Serological testing such as ELISA, IIFT and neutralization tests are effective in determining the extent of infection, including estimating asymptomatic and attack rate.<br/>
- Compared to the detection of viral genome through molecular methods, serological testing detects antibodies and antigens.<br/>
- The key limitations of genetic material detection are the lack of knowledge of the presence of viable virus, the potential cross-reactivity with non-specific genetic regions and the short timeframe for accurate detection during the acute infection phase.<br/>
- Laboratory diagnosis can be performed by: (a) detecting the genetic material of the virus, (b) detecting the antibodies that neutralize the viral particles of interest, (c) detecting the viral epitopes of interest with antibodies (serological testing), or (d) culture and isolation of viable virus particles.<br/>
- Hence, serological diagnoses are likely used when nucleic amplification tests (NAAT) are not available or accessible .<br/>

- Serological detection of 2019-nCoV respond to the epidemic: A useful complement to nucleic acid testing<br/>
- In this study, we used automated chemiluminescent immunoassay to detect serum IgM and IgG antibodies to 2019-nCoV, to understand the process of antibody production in disease progression, and to evaluate the value of antibody detection in the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19.<br/>
- It can be inferred that after the future epidemic situation has been controlled to a certain extent, as a convenient method, antibody detection is still necessary to make differential diagnosis of other respiratory pathogens infection.<br/>
- The results of this study help to provide evidence for rapid screening of suspected cases through the serological testing to curb the rapid progress of the epidemic globally.<br/>

- Considering such critical issues and the latest position papers of stakeholder associations (Various Associations, 2019a,b), the establishment of harmonized metrics to classify the impact of medicine shortage on the National Healthcare Systems is a mandatory step to enhance the cooperation among competent National Authorities of the European countries and to rationalize the efforts to mitigate them.<br/>
- Although the proposed definition was relevant only for Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs) and Regulatory Authorities, it is the first step to promote the communication and the coordination among European pharmaceutical stakeholders, regulators and professionals working in the different National Healthcare Systems for improving their resilience to shortages.<br/>
- The second HMA/EMA guideline, "Good practice guidance for communication to the public on medicines' availability issues", aimed to enhance and align the European communication on a shortage to improve the awareness of healthcare professionals and patients and the cooperation among European stakeholders (EMA and HMA, 2019b).<br/>
- Indeed, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies adopted by professionals (e.g., pharmacists) and other stakeholders can be rationalized and harmonized based on the medicines shortage impact scores calculated by a competent National Authority.<br/>

# Rapid design and execution of targeted surveillance experiments calling for all potential testers using PCR in a defined area to start testing and report to a specific entity. These experiments could aid in collecting longitudinal samples, which are critical to understanding the impact of ad hoc local interventions (which also need to be recorded).

#### Highlights<br/>
- Efforts for expedited data and results reporting should not be limited to clinical trials, but should include observational studies, operational research, routine surveillance and information on the virus and its genetic sequences, as well as the monitoring of disease control programmes.<br/>
- We think it would be useful to consider the adoption of standardized templates for reporting to ProMED in order to enhance the standardization of data and provide clear, accurate and reliable information that could be used in conducting epidemiological analyses to establish the status of emerging diseases and assist in their recognition and control, as has been previously suggested .<br/>
- This will allow developing early detection, isolation and quarantine strategies tailored to the very dynamic epidemiological situation, as well as identify potential problems in the implementation of local disease control policies and inform the design of any necessary adjustments.<br/>
- Moreover, through high-speed information quality monitoring and a professional epidemiological data statistics model, we can effectively obtain the results of the most current quality control, efficiently monitor and provide an early warning of potential risks, and feedback to hospitals and physicians at all levels, in a timely fashion, the formation of the three-level linkage of corrective programs, ultimately achieving patient and social satisfaction.<br/>

*Healthcare - 2020*<br/>
- The position of this paper is to advance that it now possible to integrate technologies like the use of smart devices through IoT networks and wearable devices, data from mobile apps and others to help users to share information with accredited and certified health professionals, and in this case, improve the outcomes for better cross disciplinary and more resilient protocols and policies.<br/>
- This is valid as smart cities host a rich array of technological products that can assist in early detection of outbreaks; either through thermal cameras or Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, and early discussions could render efforts towards better management of similar situations in case of future potential outbreaks, and to improve the health fabric of cities generally.<br/>
- The above improvements in the healthcare sector can only be achieved if different smart city products are fashioned to support standardized protocols that would allow for seamless communication between themselves.<br/>
- This hindrance can be made further possible as many cities advance in their smart and safe city model implementation towards constructing sufficient soft and hard urban infrastructures equipped with, for example, thermal imagery sensors to allow for early detections.<br/>
- With the advent of the digital age and the plethora of Internet of Things (IoT) devices it brings, there has been a substantial rise in the amount of data gathered by these devices in different sectors like transport, environment, entertainment, sport and health sectors, amongst others .<br/>
-  supports that data from various technological products can help enrich health databases, provide more accurate, efficient, comprehensive and real-time information on outbreaks and their dispersal, thus aiding in the provision of better urban fabric risk management decisions.<br/>
- In this case, novel technologies like Blockchain technologies and quantum cryptography can aid in the discussion and be made to integrate with data collecting technologies.<br/>
- Such strategies are adopted as private corporations try to maximize their economic gains, since the digital solution market is a lucrative one and is expected to continue growing and expanding .<br/>
- Secondly, these devices are usually sourced and installed by separate corporations that maintain unique and specific standards for data processing and sharing, and accordingly, tying cities to the sole usage of their product(s).<br/>

by Yinhua Zhang; Nelson Odiwuor; Jin Xiong; Luo Sun; Raphael Ohuru Nyaruaba; Hongping Wei; Nathan A Tanner<br/>
*Feb 29, 2020*<br/>
- Although a small number of samples were tested here, the colorimetric LAMP assay enables reliable SARS-CoV-2 detection without sophisticated instrumentation, matching the RT-qPCR performance in field and point-of-care settings.<br/>
- As with most molecular diagnostics, RT-qPCR is the most widely used method, but it requires expensive laboratory instruments and is difficult to utilize outside of well-equipped facilities.<br/>
- The efforts made here will serve as a model for inevitable future outbreaks where the use of next generation portable diagnostics will dramatically expand the reach of our testing capabilities for better healthcare outcomes.<br/>
- This combination of a quick sample preparation method with an easy detection process may allow the development of portable, field detection in addition to a rapid screening for point-of-need testing applications.<br/>

# Policies to mitigate the effects on supplies associated with mass testing, including swabs and reagents.

#### Highlights<br/>
-  Monitor stock and the supply chain to ensure adequate supplies of personal protective equipment.<br/>
- Management of medical supplies and stockpiling of surgical masks and other protective equipment should be done in advance and medical staff should be adequately trained in their use.<br/>
- 3, 4 Second, in the use of personal protective equipment, we should try to distinguish different risk factors, adopt different epidemic prevention measures, and reduce the waste of personal protective equipment, as these resources are already in short supply.<br/>
- Meanwhile, the supply of and demand for facemasks and other medical resources should be considered when planning for public health measures, so as to maintain the availability and affordability of medical resources.<br/>
- Large quantities of emergency supplies including personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical apparat were sent to front-line medical sectors.<br/>

*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- Based on the resulting risk ranking, the manufacturer can define proper strategies to prevent shortage (e.g., increase of the raw material suppliers, expansion of the material stocks).<br/>
- In all these cases, the notification process proposed by the EMA/HMA guideline seems not sufficient to detect the risk of shortage since the MAHs are not aware of the resilience of its raw material suppliers to shortage and, therefore, they are not able to monitor effectively raw materials suppliers and predict failures in their manufacturing chain.<br/>
- Moreover, the promising results obtained by some National competent Authorities (e.g., AIFA) suggested that setting up cooperation schemes between administration and other stakeholders, fostering a responsible approach in managing crisis in medicines supply, also allowing, for instance, surveillance/verification programs that may represent rational and effective preventive strategies to monitor the activities of exporting wholesalers and distributors for reducing the risks of product unavailability.<br/>
- Moreover, the procedure can also be adapted and applied in a hospital setting to allow pharmacists to identify those medicinal products in their stocks which are more likely to be exposed to the risk of shortages, and to set up most appropriate strategies to prevent inefficiencies in healthcare assistance caused by the shortage.<br/>
- For example, in the presence of reduced manufacturing capacity, the obligation for MAH to maintain a preventive stockpiling in some countries (e.g., Switzerland) may worsen the product availability in the other involved markets.<br/>

*Mar 05, 2020*<br/>
- The example described here serves as a call for continued training and infrastructure to support mNGS capacity in developing countries as bioinformatic tools proliferate and the cost of sequencing decreases.<br/>
- Overall, agnostic or unbiased metagenomic sequencing capabilities in-country provide the ability to detect and respond to a variety of pathogens, even those that are unanticipated or unknown.<br/>
- Despite major advances in mNGS technologies and significant decreases in costs associated with sequencing, preparation of sequencing libraries and sufficient bioinformatics capabilities for timely analysis still present a challenge in the developing world.<br/>
- Instead of being limited to consensus Sanger sequencing, which may not detect high risk quasispecies, metagenomics is a powerful approach to detect variants of both novel and known species as epidemics evolve.<br/>
- Information delay is also compounded by a dearth of sequencing and/or bioinformatics expertise in-country, further postponing analysis and dissemination of pathogen genomic information.<br/>
- 10 This newly available combination -more rugged, deployable sequencers plus user-friendly, globally accessible bioinformatics -represents an opportunity for responders in limited-resource settings; however, further proof-of-principle during outbreaks remains necessary.<br/>
- However, the other key factor in mNGS success is the accessibility to open-access, cloud-based metagenomics bioinformatics pipelines, such as IDseq which automates the process of separating host sequence characterizing the remaining non-host sequences.<br/>
- 6 For an emerging threat, this strategy offers the flexibility to successfully recover the pathogen genome in question for subsequent phylogenetic analyses without compromising discovery.<br/>
- Bridging of existing local and global resources for sequencing and analysis allows for better realtime surveillance locally, while also enabling better health pursuits overall, not just during outbreaks.<br/>
