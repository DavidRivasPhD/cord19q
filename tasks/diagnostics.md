- The key limitations of serological testing is the need to collect paired serum samples (in the acute and convalescent phases) from cases under investigation for confirmation to eliminate potential cross-reactivity from non-specific antibodies from past exposure and/or infection by other coronaviruses.<br/>
- Serological testing such as ELISA, IIFT and neutralization tests are effective in determining the extent of infection, including estimating asymptomatic and attack rate.<br/>
- Compared to the detection of viral genome through molecular methods, serological testing detects antibodies and antigens.<br/>
- Hence, serological diagnoses are likely used when nucleic amplification tests (NAAT) are not available or accessible .<br/>

- Such a procedure may be fully integrable with other existing and adopted strategies and, therefore, it may be an added value for both European Regulatory Authorities and other subjects involved in the National pharmaceutical distribution chains and healthcare systems (e.g., manufacturers, wholesalers, hospitals, pharmacies, insurance companies, regional healthcare Authorities).<br/>
- In particular, it has been highlighted the need to find collaborative solutions for medicine shortages to coordinate EU and National policies and communication campaigns.<br/>
- Indeed, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies adopted by professionals (e.g., pharmacists) and other stakeholders can be rationalized and harmonized based on the medicines shortage impact scores calculated by a competent National Authority.<br/>

# Rapid design and execution of targeted surveillance experiments calling for all potential testers using PCR in a defined area to start testing and report to a specific entity. These experiments could aid in collecting longitudinal samples, which are critical to understanding the impact of ad hoc local interventions (which also need to be recorded).

#### Highlights<br/>
- Efforts for expedited data and results reporting should not be limited to clinical trials, but should include observational studies, operational research, routine surveillance and information on the virus and its genetic sequences, as well as the monitoring of disease control programmes.<br/>
- This will allow developing early detection, isolation and quarantine strategies tailored to the very dynamic epidemiological situation, as well as identify potential problems in the implementation of local disease control policies and inform the design of any necessary adjustments.<br/>
- We think it would be useful to consider the adoption of standardized templates for reporting to ProMED in order to enhance the standardization of data and provide clear, accurate and reliable information that could be used in conducting epidemiological analyses to establish the status of emerging diseases and assist in their recognition and control, as has been previously suggested .<br/>
- There is a dearth of epidemiological data about the emerging coronavirus, which would be of crucial importance to design and implement timely, ad hoc effective public health interventions, such as contact tracing, quarantine and travel restrictions.<br/>
- In early stages of epidemics with emerging pathogens, real-time analysis of accurate and robust epidemiological and clinical data is essential to developing interventional strategies and guiding public health decisionmaking.<br/>

*Healthcare - 2020*<br/>
- The position of this paper is to advance that it now possible to integrate technologies like the use of smart devices through IoT networks and wearable devices, data from mobile apps and others to help users to share information with accredited and certified health professionals, and in this case, improve the outcomes for better cross disciplinary and more resilient protocols and policies.<br/>
- The above improvements in the healthcare sector can only be achieved if different smart city products are fashioned to support standardized protocols that would allow for seamless communication between themselves.<br/>
- This is valid as smart cities host a rich array of technological products that can assist in early detection of outbreaks; either through thermal cameras or Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, and early discussions could render efforts towards better management of similar situations in case of future potential outbreaks, and to improve the health fabric of cities generally.<br/>
- This hindrance can be made further possible as many cities advance in their smart and safe city model implementation towards constructing sufficient soft and hard urban infrastructures equipped with, for example, thermal imagery sensors to allow for early detections.<br/>
- With the advent of the digital age and the plethora of Internet of Things (IoT) devices it brings, there has been a substantial rise in the amount of data gathered by these devices in different sectors like transport, environment, entertainment, sport and health sectors, amongst others .<br/>
-  supports that data from various technological products can help enrich health databases, provide more accurate, efficient, comprehensive and real-time information on outbreaks and their dispersal, thus aiding in the provision of better urban fabric risk management decisions.<br/>
- In this case, novel technologies like Blockchain technologies and quantum cryptography can aid in the discussion and be made to integrate with data collecting technologies.<br/>
- Such strategies are adopted as private corporations try to maximize their economic gains, since the digital solution market is a lucrative one and is expected to continue growing and expanding .<br/>

by Yinhua Zhang; Nelson Odiwuor; Jin Xiong; Luo Sun; Raphael Ohuru Nyaruaba; Hongping Wei; Nathan A Tanner<br/>
*Feb 29, 2020*<br/>
- Although a small number of samples were tested here, the colorimetric LAMP assay enables reliable SARS-CoV-2 detection without sophisticated instrumentation, matching the RT-qPCR performance in field and point-of-care settings.<br/>
- This combination of a quick sample preparation method with an easy detection process may allow the development of portable, field detection in addition to a rapid screening for point-of-need testing applications.<br/>
- As with most molecular diagnostics, RT-qPCR is the most widely used method, but it requires expensive laboratory instruments and is difficult to utilize outside of well-equipped facilities.<br/>
- The efforts made here will serve as a model for inevitable future outbreaks where the use of next generation portable diagnostics will dramatically expand the reach of our testing capabilities for better healthcare outcomes.<br/>

*Clinical & Translational Immunology - 2020*<br/>
- 4 I argue this exposes an 'Achilles Heel' that may be safely targeted via host-oriented therapies to impose devastating informational and fitness barriers on escape mutant selection.<br/>
- 14 I predict these efforts will unlock a vast wealth of currently unexplored biodiversity, leading to biotechnologies and treatments that leverage the host-virus interactions developed throughout evolution.<br/>
- 4 I anticipate international efforts in these areas over the coming decade will enable the tapping of useful new biological functions and processes, methods for controlling infection, and the deployment of symbiotic or subclinical viruses in new therapies and biotechnologies that are so crucially needed.<br/>
- Achieving this through drug repurposing will break the vicious cycle of escalating therapeutic development costs and trivial escape mutant selection, both quickly and in multiple places.<br/>
- 10 I anticipate further improvements in the performance of such devices over the coming decade will transform virus surveillance efforts, the importance of which was underscored by the recent EboV and novel coronavirus (nCoV / COVID-19) outbreaks, enabling rapid deployment of antiviral treatments that take resistance-conferring mutations into account.<br/>

#### Highlights<br/>
-  Monitor stock and the supply chain to ensure adequate supplies of personal protective equipment.<br/>
- Management of medical supplies and stockpiling of surgical masks and other protective equipment should be done in advance and medical staff should be adequately trained in their use.<br/>
- These include infection control decisions regarding the limited availability of isolation rooms and personal protective equipment (PPE), particularly in more resource-constrained settings.<br/>
- 3, 4 Second, in the use of personal protective equipment, we should try to distinguish different risk factors, adopt different epidemic prevention measures, and reduce the waste of personal protective equipment, as these resources are already in short supply.<br/>

*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- Based on the resulting risk ranking, the manufacturer can define proper strategies to prevent shortage (e.g., increase of the raw material suppliers, expansion of the material stocks).<br/>
- Moreover, the promising results obtained by some National competent Authorities (e.g., AIFA) suggested that setting up cooperation schemes between administration and other stakeholders, fostering a responsible approach in managing crisis in medicines supply, also allowing, for instance, surveillance/verification programs that may represent rational and effective preventive strategies to monitor the activities of exporting wholesalers and distributors for reducing the risks of product unavailability.<br/>
- In all these cases, the notification process proposed by the EMA/HMA guideline seems not sufficient to detect the risk of shortage since the MAHs are not aware of the resilience of its raw material suppliers to shortage and, therefore, they are not able to monitor effectively raw materials suppliers and predict failures in their manufacturing chain.<br/>
- On the other side, if the shortage impact of medicinal products on the public health is low, it is not reasonable to charge the MAHs with additional costs and, therefore, affect the economic sustainability for the implementation of quality assurance systems that may have a limited positive impact on the continuity of care.<br/>
- For such products, manufacturer's resilience should be improved by more onerous provisions, such as the obligation for MAHs to qualify at least two suppliers of drug substance, the stockpiles' expansion and the implementation of the manufacturing technologies and risk assessment tools.<br/>
- These strategies permit to improve MAH sustainability and to ensure a proper supply for the patient demand.<br/>

by Musazzi, Umberto M.; Di Giorgio, Domenico; Minghetti, Paola<br/>
*International Journal of Pharmaceutics - Apr 15, 2020*<br/>
- This manuscript aims to review the current upgrade of the European regulatory framework on medicine shortages and to propose a theoretical approach for 1) determining the shortage/unavailability impact on the capability of the National Healthcare Systems and 2) rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted in function of the leading cause of shortage (e.g., production, price and importation/exportation).<br/>
- Although the proposed definition was relevant only for Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs) and Regulatory Authorities, it is the first step to promote the communication and the coordination among European pharmaceutical stakeholders, regulators and professionals working in the different National Healthcare Systems for improving their resilience to shortages.<br/>
- In particular, it has been highlighted the need to find collaborative solutions for medicine shortages to coordinate EU and National policies and communication campaigns.<br/>
- For such products, manufacturer's resilience should be improved by more onerous provisions, such as the obligation for MAHs to qualify at least two suppliers of drug substance, the stockpiles' expansion and the implementation of the manufacturing technologies and risk assessment tools.<br/>

*Mar 05, 2020*<br/>
- Overall, agnostic or unbiased metagenomic sequencing capabilities in-country provide the ability to detect and respond to a variety of pathogens, even those that are unanticipated or unknown.<br/>
- The example described here serves as a call for continued training and infrastructure to support mNGS capacity in developing countries as bioinformatic tools proliferate and the cost of sequencing decreases.<br/>
- Instead of being limited to consensus Sanger sequencing, which may not detect high risk quasispecies, metagenomics is a powerful approach to detect variants of both novel and known species as epidemics evolve.<br/>
- Despite major advances in mNGS technologies and significant decreases in costs associated with sequencing, preparation of sequencing libraries and sufficient bioinformatics capabilities for timely analysis still present a challenge in the developing world.<br/>
- Bridging of existing local and global resources for sequencing and analysis allows for better realtime surveillance locally, while also enabling better health pursuits overall, not just during outbreaks.<br/>
- 6 For an emerging threat, this strategy offers the flexibility to successfully recover the pathogen genome in question for subsequent phylogenetic analyses without compromising discovery.<br/>
- However, the other key factor in mNGS success is the accessibility to open-access, cloud-based metagenomics bioinformatics pipelines, such as IDseq which automates the process of separating host sequence characterizing the remaining non-host sequences.<br/>
- 10 This newly available combination -more rugged, deployable sequencers plus user-friendly, globally accessible bioinformatics -represents an opportunity for responders in limited-resource settings; however, further proof-of-principle during outbreaks remains necessary.<br/>
- Information delay is also compounded by a dearth of sequencing and/or bioinformatics expertise in-country, further postponing analysis and dissemination of pathogen genomic information.<br/>
